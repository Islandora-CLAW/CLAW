Out of the box, this includes: A suite of customized Drupal resource types and configurations, packaged as the Islandora 8 Drupal module , that streamline the process of creating preservable digital resources natively within Drupal as nodes, media, files, and taxonomy terms Complete integration between Drupal resources and Duraspace's Fedora 5.x Repository , including RDF conversion and asset storage The Crayfish suite of microservices that Islandora uses to provide automated resource mapping to Fedora and automated generation of derivative files, and which can be extended to provide even more services The Alpaca suite of middleware that asynchronously manages and queues microservices in the background - like the ones bundled with Crayfish - providing scalability A batch import/migration framework to serve as a launching point to get your existing data into Islandora 8 Preservation tools like controlled access terms for subjects and agents and a full configuration for exposing OAI-PMH to metadata harvesters Discoverability tools like JSON-LD serialization for linked data, IIIF support , and an Openseadragon viewer for image display A dedicated, active community working to push new features, collaborate on improvements, design custom solutions, and create extended functionality As native Drupal content, Islandora resources can also be integrated with existing Drupal tools like the Solr Search API , Matomo Analytics , RDF schema building , and much more. Islandora 8 comes with a comprehensive default site configuration for Drupal to get you started, and even an Ansible playbook that will quickly get you up and running so you can try it out.","title":"Summary"},{"location":"installation/","text":"Islandora 8 is installed through an Ansible Playbook called islandora-playbook . Requirements Download and install the following: Virtual Box Vagrant (version 2.0 or required) Then use your package manager of choice to get Git . # Ubuntu $ sudo apt-get install git # Centos $ sudo yum install git # OSX $ brew install git As well as OpenSSL # Ubuntu $ sudo apt-get install openssl # Centos $ sudo yum install openssl # OSX $ brew install openssl Finally, install Ansible up to version 2.8.7. This is done best with pip , the python package manager. If pip isn\u2019t already available on your system of Python, run the following commands to install it: $ curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py $ python get-pip.py --user Then pin down Ansible to 2.8.7 $ pip install --user -Iv ansible==2.8.7 If you want to provision a CENTOS 7 environment, you'll also need to install the vbguest plugin for Vagrant $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest Installing a local development environment Once you've installed all the requirements, you can spin up a local development environment with $ git clone https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/islandora-playbook $ cd islandora-playbook $ vagrant up By default, this provisions an Ubuntu 18.04 environment. If you would prefer to use CENTOS 7 instead, set the ISLANDORA_DISTRO environment variable to centos/7 . To prevent having to do this every time you open a new shell, add the following command to your .bashrc file $ export ISLANDORA_DISTRO=\"centos/7\" Installing a remote environment If you want to provision a remote server using the playbook, there's a handful of configuration entries you need to update to include your usernames/passwords and IP addresses. You'll also want Apache to serve at port 80 as opposed to 8000, which we use for development purposes. To start, take the inventory for the vagrant development environment and copy it. Be sure to give it an appropriate name. Here we're using example . $ git clone https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/islandora-playbook $ cd islandora-playbook $ cp -r inventory/vagrant inventory/example Then you can update the following entries in the following files using your own information. If an entry does not exist in a file, just add it. Ansible will then use the value you provide instead of relying on its defaults. We're using changeme to represent passwords and assume the server will be available at example.org , but you'll want to provide your own values. group_vars/all/passwords.yml drupal_db_password: changeme drupal_account_pass: changeme islandora_db_root_password: changeme islandora_tomcat_password: changeme islandora_syn_token: changeme cantaloupe_admin_password: changeme group_vars/crayfish.yml crayfish_gemini_fedora_base_url: http://example.org:8080/fcrepo/rest crayfish_houdini_fedora_base_url: http://example.org:8080/fcrepo/rest crayfish_hypercube_fedora_base_url: http://example.org:8080/fcrepo/rest crayfish_milliner_fedora_base_url: http://example.org:8080/fcrepo/rest crayfish_milliner_drupal_base_url: http://example.org crayfish_milliner_gemini_base_url: http://example.org/gemini crayfish_homarus_fedora_base_url: http://example.org:8080/fcrepo/rest crayfish_recast_fedora_base_url: http://example.org:8080/fcrepo/rest crayfish_recast_drupal_base_url: http://example.org crayfish_recast_gemini_base_url: http://example.org/gemini group_vars/karaf.yml Unfortunately, you have to copy/paste this whole chunk into the yml, even though you're only updating the URLs and the token.value entry. alpaca_settings: - pid: ca.islandora.alpaca.http.client settings: token.value: changeme - pid: org.fcrepo.camel.indexing.triplestore settings: input.stream: activemq:topic:fedora triplestore.reindex.stream: activemq:queue:triplestore.reindex triplestore.baseUrl: http://example.org:8080/bigdata/namespace/islandora/sparql - pid: ca.islandora.alpaca.indexing.triplestore settings: error.maxRedeliveries: 10 index.stream: activemq:queue:islandora-indexing-triplestore-index delete.stream: activemq:queue:islandora-indexing-triplestore-delete triplestore.baseUrl: http://example.org:8080/bigdata/namespace/islandora/sparql - pid: ca.islandora.alpaca.indexing.fcrepo settings: error.maxRedeliveries: 5 node.stream: activemq:queue:islandora-indexing-fcrepo-content node.delete.stream: activemq:queue:islandora-indexing-fcrepo-delete media.stream: activemq:queue:islandora-indexing-fcrepo-media file.stream: activemq:queue:islandora-indexing-fcrepo-file file.delete.stream: activemq:queue:islandora-indexing-fcrepo-file-delete milliner.baseUrl: http://example.org/milliner/ gemini.baseUrl: http://example.org/gemini/ alpaca_blueprint_settings: - pid: ca.islandora.alpaca.connector.houdini in_stream: activemq:queue:islandora-connector-houdini derivative_service_url: http://example.org/houdini/convert error_max_redeliveries: 5 camel_context_id: IslandoraConnectorHoudini - pid: ca.islandora.alpaca.connector.homarus in_stream: activemq:queue:islandora-connector-homarus derivative_service_url: http://example.org/homarus/convert error_max_redeliveries: 5 camel_context_id: IslandoraConnectorHomarus group_vars/tomcat.yml fcrepo_allowed_external_content: - http://example.org/ cantaloupe_HttpResolver_BasicLookupStrategy_url_prefix: http://example.org/ group_vars/webserver/apache.yml Here's where you set the port to 80 instead of 8000. apache_listen_port: 80 group_vars/webserver/drupal.yml drupal_trusted_hosts: - ^localhost$ - example.org fedora_base_url: \"http://example.org:8080/fcrepo/rest/\" group_vars/webserver/general.yml openseadragon_iiiv_server: http://example.org:8080/cantaloupe/iiif/2 matomo_site_url: http://example.org hosts You'll need the ssh particulars for logging into your server in the hosts file.

Workflows The group meets each Wednesday at 1:00 PM Eastern. Meeting notes and announcements are posted to the Islandora community list and the Islandora developers list . You can view meeting agendas, notes, and call-in information here . Anybody is welcome to join the calls, and add items to the agenda. Use cases If you would like to submit a use case to the Islandora 8 project, please submit an issue here using the Use Case template , prepending \"Use Case:\" to the title of the issue. Documentation You can contribute documentation in two different ways. One way is to create an issue here , prepending \"Documentation:\" to the title of the issue. Another way is by pull request, which is the same process as Contribute Code . All documentation resides in docs . Request a new feature To request a new feature you should open an issue in the Islandora 8 repository or create a use case (see the Use cases section above), and summarize the desired functionality. Prepend \"Enhancement:\" if creating an issue on the project repo, and \"Use Case:\" if creating a use case. Report a bug To report a bug you should open an issue in the Islandora 8 repository that summarizes the bug. Prepend the label \"Bug:\" to the title of the issue. In order to help us understand and fix the bug it would be great if you could provide us with: The steps to reproduce the bug. This includes information about e.g. the Islandora version you were using along with the versions of stack components. The expected behavior. The actual, incorrect behavior. Feel free to search the issue queue for existing issues (aka tickets) that already describe the problem; if there is such a ticket please add your information as a comment. If you want to provide a pull along with your bug report: That is great! In this case please send us a pull request as described in the section Create a pull request below. Contribute code Before you set out to contribute code you will need to have completed a Contributor License Agreement or be covered by a Corporate Contributor License Agreement . The signed copy of the license agreement should be sent to community@islandora.ca If you are interested in contributing code to Islandora but do not know where to begin: In this case you should browse open issues and check out use cases . If you are contributing Drupal code, it must adhere to Drupal Coding Standards ; Travis CI will check for this on pull requests. Contributions to the Islandora codebase should be sent as GitHub pull requests. See section Create a pull request below for details. If there is any problem with the pull request we can work through it using the commenting features of GitHub. For small patches , feel free to submit pull requests directly for those patches. For larger code contributions , please use the following process. The idea behind this process is to prevent any wasted work and catch design issues early on. Open an issue , prepending \"Enhancement:\" in the title if a similar issue does not exist already. If a similar issue does exist, then you may consider participating in the work on the existing issue. Comment on the issue with your plan for implementing the issue. Explain what pieces of the codebase you are going to touch and how everything is going to fit together. Islandora committers will work with you on the design to make sure you are on the right track. Implement your issue, create a pull request (see below), and iterate from there. Create a pull request Take a look at Creating a pull request . In a nutshell you need to: Fork this repository to your personal or institutional GitHub account (depending on the CLA you are working under). Be cautious of which branches you work from though (you'll want to base your work off master, or for Drupal modules use the most recent version branch). See Fork a repo for detailed instructions. Commit any changes to your fork. Send a pull request using the pull request template to the Islandora GitHub repository that you forked in step 1. If your pull request is related to an existing issue -- for instance, because you reported a bug/issue earlier -- prefix the title of your pull request with the corresponding issue number (e.g. issue-123: ... ). Please also include a reference to the issue in the description of the pull. This can be done by using '#' plus the issue number like so '#123', also try to pick an appropriate name for the branch in which you're issuing the pull request from. You may want to read Syncing a fork for instructions on how to keep your fork up to date with the latest changes of the upstream (official) repository.

Overview Choosing how we work together is an important privilege the Islandora community offers to its contributors. Our workflow is built around engagement and consensus to encourage high quality code that is expected to meet defined standards. All contributors are expected to follow the defined workflow. Any contributor can propose changes to the workflow at any time by initiating a conversation on the mailing list. Any proposed changes must be confirmed by the committers by way of an Apache rules vote in order to take effect. Social Dynamics We operate under the Islandora Community Code of Conduct . Some additional general observations to keep in mind when interacting with others in this workflow: We are all volunteers Time/attention of others is a limited resource. You cannot impose on others what to do. You should be motivated to do things by yourself. Common need is the driving force. Friendly cooperation is how its done Your contribution should not overstrain others. Your contribution is valuable when others appreciate it. Islandora is constantly improving You are expected to make high quality contributions You must be able to adapt to change Workflow: General Guidelines: Identify if a Github issue is needed: Minor grammar / php warning: no ticket required Feature or Fix beyond the minimal: Github Issue Unsure? Play it safe and make a Github Issue Prioritizing pull requests: If there is an urgent need for the pull request to be addressed quickly, indicate the need in the pull request template or a comment. Complexity should also be taken into account when evaluating how quickly to merge a pull request. Changes that affect core modules or make extensive changes should receive more review and testing. All interested parties should be satisfied before something is merged; no hard numbers. If you know who is likely to be interested, tag them. Tag the creator of the issue if possible. Make a reasonable effort. If a pull request languishes without response when one is needed, tag @Islandora/8-x-committers (or @Islandora-Devops/committers if you\u2019re working on install code) with a reminder and/or put the issue on the agenda for the next Islandora 8 Tech Call All contributions to GitHub must be accompanied by either an Individual Contributor License or a Corporate Contributor License covering the contributor. Development Workflow: Create a Github Issue if none exists Assign the issue to yourself or request it to be assigned in a comment on the issue. Be sure to tag @Islandora/8-x-committers to bring attention to it. Perform development on a \u2018feature\u2019 branch. Give your branch a name that describes the issue or feature. Using something like \u2018issue-xxx\u2018 and including the issue number is always a safe bet if you don\u2019t know what to name it. When the code is ready for review, issue a pull request on Github from your feature branch into the development branch (\u20188.x-1.x\u2019 for Drupal modules and \u2018dev\u2019 for everything else) Continuous integration checks need to be satisfied before the code can be merged Coding standards checks and copy/paste mess detection must be passing before code can be merged. Automated tests are also expected to pass before code can be merged, however at times there can be extenuating circumstances preventing this. For example, sometimes there is a disconnect between running tests locally versus on the continuous integration server. If tests run locally and everyone involved in the pull request is in agreement, the check for automated tests can be ignored. But this isn\u2019t a common occurrence. Code coverage checks are more of a guideline than a strict requirement. A reasonable effort to provide tests for contributed code is expected. However, demanding 100% code coverage for all contributed code is unreasonable. If tests have been provided or updated and everyone involved in the pull request is in agreement, code coverage checks can be ignored. The code is reviewed and tested by the community, with all feedback and further development performed within the pull request.

Pull requests should also not be merged by committers who are peers in the same organization as those who provided code. Always \u201cSquash and Merge\u201d , please. Close the Github issue If you add the keyword \u201cfixes\u201d or \u201cresolves\u201d on the same line when referencing the Github Issue in the PR description, it will auto-close the issue when the PR is merged. Otherwise, make a comment referencing the new commit and close the issue manually. Release Workflow During release, the same workflow holds, it is just performed against the \u2018release\u2019 branch of a repository instead of \u2018dev\u2019 or \u20188.x-1.x\u2019.

Because Fedora 4 and 5 are vastly different than Fedora 3, so too is Islandora 8 a major departure from what came before. Switching to Islandora 8 represents not just a typical upgrade with improvements, features, and bug fixes, but rather a major shift in how objects are stored and managed. Moving from Islandora 7.x-1.x to 8.x-1.x requires a migration of objects, which you can learn about here . It also requires some adjustments in how you think about your objects and their relationships, and how to manage them in Islandora, which we will cover below. You can also check out some of the documentation provided by the Fedora project: * Concept Mapping - Fedora 3 to 4 * The Fedora 5 object model * Fedora 3 to 4 Upgration * LDP-PCDM-F4 In Action Fedora Repository Structure Fedora 3 stored all objects at the top level of the repository, although presentation of the objects could mimic a directory structure by having objects 'in' collections and collections 'in' other collections. This image is a helpful oversimplification: Fedora 4/5 differs considerably in that there is an innate tree hierarchy to the repository rather than a flat structure. Put less simply, \" a Fedora repository consists of a directed acyclic graph of resources where edges represent a parent-child relation \". Object Structure Fedora 3 objects are FOXML (Fedora Object eXtensible Markup Language) documents, with three elements: Digital Object Identifier : A unique, persistent identifier for the digital object. Also known as the PID. System Properties : A set of system-defined descriptive properties that is necessary to manage and track the object in the repository. Datastream(s) : The element in a Fedora digital object that represents a content item. In Fedora 4/5 , what we would have called objects are now referred to as Resources (and everything in Fedora 4/5 is a Resource ). Instead of being composed of XML as they were in Fedora 3, they are stored in ModeShape as nodes with RDF properties. Resources come in two flavors: RDF Sources , which are Resources having only RDF data, and Non-RDF Sources , which are Resources that are binary files (HTML, PDFs, images, audio, video, etc). The terms [ RDF Source ] and [ Non-RDF Source ] both come from the W3C's Linked Data Platform specification, which also defines the idea of Linked Data Platform Containers , or LDPCs . An LDPC is an RDF Source that functions as a collection of Resources , similar to the way Islandora 7.x-1.x compound objects exist only as a way to tie together its children. An LDPC may contain Non-RDF Sources , as well as other RDF Sources acting as LDPCs ; you can have a container of containers just like how Islandora 7.x-1.x can have a collection of collections. Islandora 8.x-1.x makes use of the Portland Common Data Model (PCDM) as a layer of abstraction over LDPCs to make containment simpler to understand for users; a pcdm:Collection may contain other pcdm:Collections or pcdm:Objects (similar to an Islandora 7.x-1.x collection content model), and a pcdm:Object may contain other pcdm:Objects (similar to the way an Islandora 7.x-1.x compound object has child objects) or pcdm:Files (similar to the way Islandora 7.x-1.x objects have datastreams). Datastreams In Islandora 7.x-1.x, every object has a specific content model which defined what datastreams it could have and which were absolutely required. Some of these Islandora 7.x-1.x datastreams contained metadata about the object while others contained binary files (JPG, PDF, MP3, PNG, TIFF, etc). In Islandora 8.x-1.x, all metadata about a resource is stored as RDF attributes directly on the resource itself, whether that resource is a pcdm:Collection , pcdm:Object or a pcdm:File , so we no longer need to separate metadata by type (RELS-EXT, RELS-INT, MODS, DC, PREMIS, etc) and store it in binary files as we did in Islandora 7.x-1.x. Binary files, such as JPGs, PNGs, MP3s, and PDFs, are handled via pcdm:Files which are contained by a parent pcdm:Object , similar to how an Islandora 7.x-1.x cmodel may hold a PDF or JPG as a datastream. Unlike Islandora 7.x-1.x, these binary files can actually have their own technical metadata attached them. This is because pcdm:Collections , pcdm:Objects and even pcdm:Files are all RDF Sources containing only RDF data, with pcdm:Files having links to the URL of the Non-RDF Source (binary file) they represent as part of their RDF data in addition to whatever other metadata you may want about the file. Using this system, a pcdm:Object can contain as many pcdm:Files as necessary, and each pcdm:File can have separate metadata about itself and its relationship to other pcdm:Files attached to the parent pcdm:Object , serving the same purpose RELS-INT datastreams served in Islandora 7.x-1.x. Note that you can use a pcdm:File to represent a file of metadata, such as MODS, DC, or PBCore, in case you would like to preserve a copy of an object's legacy metadata when migrating into Fedora 4. These metadata files will be treated like any other binary file in Islandora 8.x-1.x, and will not be indexed or editable through the GUI. PIDs Every object in a Fedora 3 repository had a Persistent Identifier following the pattern namespace:pid . Fedora 4/5 resources do not have PIDs. Instead, since Fedora 4 is an LDP server , their identifiers are fundamentally their URIs. The PIDs of objects migrated from a Fedora 3 repository can still be stored in Fedora 4/5, as additional properties on the new Fedora 4 resource. Since resources are stored as nodes on the Drupal side of Islandora 8.x-1.x, they also have Drupal UUIDs.","title":"What's Different Between Islandora 1.x and Islandora 8.x"},{"location":"inactive/different_from_7x/#whats-different-between-islandora-1x-and-islandora-8x","text":"In the most basic terms, Islandora 8 is the version of Islandora that works with Fedora 5 .

Islandora 7.x-1.x (with Fedora 3) Islandora 7.x-1.x is \"middleware\", it allows Drupal 7.x to talk to a Fedora 3 server instead of Drupal's database. This is sometimes expressed as a hamburger: Islandora 8 (with Fedora X) Note : The Fedora project adopted semantic versioning and no longer can be referred to by a single verison number like \"Fedora 3\" could be with regards to Islandora 7.x-1.x. Due to this change and because with the adoption of the Fedora API specification we can support multiple versions of Fedora with minimal or no change to our implementation, we use the term \"Fedora X\" to refer to all current and future Fedora versions supported by Islandora 8 in this document. Islandora 8 does more than simply replace that base layer with Fedora X. It is a total re-architecting of the interaction between the various pieces, acting as middleware for not only Drupal 8.x and Fedora X, but also Solr, Blazegraph, and any microservices added to the stack. Islandora 8 achieves this by implementing a system of \"plumbing\" using Apache Camel to pass messages between all the different parts of the stack to keep them in sync with each other. Rather than a hamburger, Islandora 8 is a chimera : This new structure has several advantages: Parcelling out the various services and dependencies allows for more horizontal scalability Changing the relationship between Drupal and Fedora allows for a more flexible approach to front-end management (i.e, it need not be Drupal) while also taking much greater advantage of features available from Drupal (i.e, Fedora objects are treated more like nodes, for the purposes of using Drupal contrib modules. Many Islandora 7.x-1.x modules are redundant in Islandora 8 because they reproduce existing Drupal contrib modules that can be used out of the box in Islandora 8). Easier to keep up-to-date as not all pieces must be versioned together. Installations tools (Ansible, Docker, Vagrant) can automate uniting the pieces in a simple, clean installation process. Islandora has always been a turn-key repository solution, in the sense that it needs no customization once installed. With Islandora 8, that installation process is much smoother, with automated solutions that can be used in production. Ecosystem Alpaca The plumbing for Islandora's asynchronous workflows. It handles reading from and writing to message queues, with appropriate retry rules and error handling. Chullo A PHP client for Fedora X built using Guzzle and EasyRdf. Crayfish Top level container for the various Islandora 8 microservices. Islandora The main Drupal module associated with Islandora 8. Work is underway to have this as a project on drupal.org . Why Switch? Islandora 7.x-1.x is a tried and tested product with a vibrant user and contributor community and many tools and add-ons available to customize and expand its uses. Islandora 8 is a major departure, representing a great deal of work both in development of the software, and to migrate and upgrade existing Islandora sites. So why make the change? Fedora The primary motive for moving to Islandora 8 is to stay current with the repository layer of our ecosystem. Moving to Fedora X is vital for the long-term utility of the project. Fedora 3 is End-of-Life and has not been supported since 2015. This means that there will be no improvements, bug fixes, or security patches released for the software, drastically increasing individual maintenance needs for adopters. Fedora 3 experiences significant slowdown when repositories reach a large (millions) number of objects. Fedora X is much more scalable, and is specifically engineered to be horizontally scalable in ways that Fedora 3 cannot. Drupal Drupal 8 has been officially released and development has begun on Drupal 9. Official Drupal policy will see Drupal 7 become unsupported when Drupal 9 is released, putting it in the same precarious territory as Fedora 3. The initial phases of Islandora 8 development worked with Drupal 7 as a front-end, but Islandora 8 has been architected with a pivot to Drupal 8 in mind from its very inception. As of June, 2016, Islandora 8 development has pivoted fully to Drupal 8, ensuring that when the Islandora Community is ready to make the move, there will be a version of Islandora that functions with the latest and best-supported versions of both our front-end and repository layers by pairing Drupal 8 with Fedora X. Community-Driven Design The Islandora community has grown significantly since the project began, both in terms of users and contributors. For the first time, we are in a position to have a truly community-driven development process, in which any Islandora user can participate at whatever level fits their interests and abilities. Islandora 8 has worked with the broader Islandora community to solicit use-cases, put forward prospectuses and project plans for review and editing, and has been developed with a mix of funding from Islandora Foundation members and volunteer developers working on sprints. Islandora 8 is developed by the Islandora community, for the Islandora community. As a member of the Islandora community, you can help to steer the direction it takes. Linked Data Linked Data is a big concept. A definition by Tim Berners-Lee from 2006 articulates the basic idea in the context of the \"Semantic Web\": It is about making links, so that a person or machine can explore the web of data. With linked data, when you have some of it, you can find other, related, data. Like the web of hypertext, the web of data is constructed with documents on the web. However, unlike the web of hypertext, where links are relationships anchors in hypertext documents written in HTML, for data they links between arbitrary things described by RDF. The URIs identify any kind of object or concept. But for HTML or RDF, the same expectations apply to make the web grow: Use URIs as names for things Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names. When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards (RDF*, SPARQL) Include links to other URIs. so that they can discover more things. LDP is an official W3C recommendation. According to the spec , Linked Data Platform (LDP) defines a set of rules for HTTP operations on web resources, some based on RDF, to provide an architecture for read-write Linked Data on the web. Put more simply: An LDP server is a web server that lets you manage relationships in RDF by creating URLs you can perform CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) operation on: http://my_url/some_resource http://my_url/some_resource/children http://my_url/some_resource/children/child_resource <> prefix:isChildOf <http://my_url/some_resource> An LDP server also lets you request the RDF graph for a resource with varying levels of additional information for discovery: The resource itself The resource plus child resources The resource plus all other resources that reference it (inbound references) The resource plus children plus inbound references Fedora X is an LDP implementation. It stores metadata using RDF (Resource Description Framework), a standard format for data interchange on the web. RDF data is formatted as triples, like so: <resource_uri> <predicate_uri> <object_uri> and can be exported in many different formats: JSON-LD RDF/XML Turtle N-Triples Working with RDF is not entirely new in the Islandora/Fedora context, as RELS-EXT and RELS-INT have always been RDF/XML. Related objects can be included in RDF, so it functions as a graph you can traverse in order to discover more information. Example: Dublin Core as XML and RDF using the dc namespace Dublin Core XML you store with the resource. <?xml version=\"1.0\"?> <metadata xmlns=\"http://example.org/myapp/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://example.org/myapp/ http://example.org/myapp/schema.xsd\" xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"> <dc:title> Islandora </dc:title> <dc:description> Islandora is an open-source software framework designed to help institutions and organizations and their audiences collaboratively manage, and discover digital assets using a best-practices framework. </dc:description> </metadata> vs RDF (which is actually properties of the resource) @prefix dc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/> . <http://islandora.ca/> dc:title \"Islandora\" ; dc:description \"Islandora is an open-source software framework designed to help institutions and organizations and their audiences collaboratively manage, and discover digital assets using a best-practices framework.\" .

In order to aid in that transition, we are defining the minimum viable product. This will defend against scope creep, give clearly defined goals for community members to work towards, and present the point at which the development team feels the software is ready to be tested out in small installations. Needless to say, since this is a minimum product, a lot of parts of the previous prototype are either going to get replaced by an existing project to ease the maintenance load, or be removed altogether until time and resources allow other development. High Level Features These are what are considered the minimum requirements for a functional Islandora 8 that is worthy of a 1.0.0 release. Content modeled in Drupal as Entities using PCDM 1.0 REST API exposed for Drupal Entities Support for collections, images, books, and pages The ability to control metadata mappings between Drupal and RDF Provide RDF based default descriptive metadata profile in Drupal The ability to export/import JSON-LD Automatic backup of Drupal content in Fedora 4 Ability to restore/bootstrap a Drupal site from a properly structured Fedora 4 repository The ability to index and search resources with Apache Solr The ability to restrict access to collections and/or individual resources across all representations (Drupal, Fedora, Solr, etc\u2026) Asynchronous derivative generation Vagrant environment for development purposes, which will serve as a starting point for more complicated, distributed installs Architecture Overview Islandora is composed of four broad categories of technologies. On one end, there is the administrative interface, which users and other clients will interact with. On the other is a repository, which will hold binary data and RDF triples. In between the two are connectors, which are small pieces of software that react to events from either administrative interface or the repository. These connectors will utilize microservices -- small utilities exposed as web services either internally or out on the internet at large. Administrative Interface Drupal 8 Drupal 8 provides a content management system (CMS for short) that allows end users the ability to create, edit, publish, and present digital content. Clients will interact with Drupal 8 via a browser or through a http client (such as cURL ) in order to manipulate digital content. With each write operation, messages will be emitted to an event stream for processing by connectors. SQL DB Drupal 8 requires a MySQL (or drop-in replacement) or Postgres database. Search Engine Existing Drupal 8 modules for Apache Solr or Elastic Search will be utilized to provide full text search. Microservices A microservice is a small web service with functionality related to a single problem, even if it exposes just a single function. It can be deployed and configured independently of any other service, even having its own database if necessary. It can even be something that we don\u2019t directly maintain or control ourselves. ID Mapping Service Identifiers between Fedora and Drupal need to be aligned so we can trace our way from one end of the system to the other. Implementing it as a microservice decouples this functionality from the rest of the codebase, allowing it to change or be pluggable with different mapping functions. It will utilize its own database. The ID indexing connector will be its primary client, updating the registry of IDs in response to repository events. Image Conversion Service Image conversion is a common operation in a content repository. Thumbnails, lower resolution copies for everyday access, and JP2s for use with IIIF image servers need to be generated when preservation masters are added or updated. This can be easily implemented by exposing ImageMagick\u2019s convert command as a microservice. Text Extraction Service Text extraction on PDFs or images of written text can be utilized to provide searching capabilities on content of a book or document. Ghostscript can be used on text based PDF\u2019s. Images will require an OCR utility like Tesseract . FITS Web Service The FITS web service is an already existing project that extracts technical metadata and produces FITS xml files. Repository Fedora Fedora 4 houses binary content along with RDF triples for metadata about repository content. It also conforms to the LDP specification, allowing for manipulation of relationships through HTTP operations. API-X API-X allows Islandora to extend the Fedora 4 API. Microservices are registered in API-X and then \u2018bound\u2019 to repository content. A proxy sitting in front of Fedora exposes microservices as functions on repository content, which all HTTP requests must be routed through. For example, suppose Islandora is running the FITS web service described above. Then let\u2019s say we \u2018bind\u2019 it to all binaries in Fedora, with an identifier of \u2018fits\u2019. If we have a binary file at http://fedora-host.com/fcrepo/rest/binaries/example , then instead of writing code to retrieve the content and forward it to our FITS service, we simply visit the proxy at http://apix-host.com/fcrepo/rest/binaries/example/fits . Since services can be described, and that information is made available to interested clients, other applications can make informed decisions about what services are available for particular resources. Triplestore RDF content is indexed in a SPARQL 1.1 compliant triplestore. Connectors Connectors are small programs that listen to the event streams of either the Fedora repository or Drupal. In response to events, they perform actions, often bridging two pieces of technology together (like indexing a triplestore, hence \u2018connectors\u2019). Apache Camel is a natural fit for these types of programs. Connectors will often delegate larger chunks of work to microservices, either bound to content through API-X or used stand-alone. They are primarily concerned with guaranteeing that events are responded to in a idempotent fashion. Due to the nature of asynchronous messaging, certain guarantees, such as timeliness of delivery, cannot be made. So connectors may need to retry a couple of times, or know to ignore a message that\u2019s delivered late or applied twice. This is why it\u2019s important that operations are idempotent. ID Indexer A connector will listen to Fedora events and index unique IDs contained in RDF using the ID Mapping microservice. The predicate used to notate unique IDs can be controlled through configuration. Triplestore Indexer A connector will listen to Fedora events and index RDF in a SPARQL 1.1 triplestore. This is provided by the Fedora community as part of the fcrepo-camel-toolbox project. Sync A sub-project of Alpaca that provides two connectors for keeping information between Fedora and Drupal in sync. One, which indexes content in Fedora from Drupal events, is always running. The other, which indexes content in Drupal based on state in Fedora, is manually triggered through a re-indexing process like other fcrepo-camel-toolbox connectors. Alpaca Alpaca responds to creation and update events for binary files and creates derivative files based on the microservices it finds available for that type of binary in API-X. Derivatives are then ingested into Drupal, with Sync making sure they get flushed back to Fedora. Request Flows Here are the proposed flows for all the different types of requests you can make against repository objects. Read a Resource Suppose a client views a resource in Islandora through their browser. A request is made to Drupal, which looks up the resource in an SQL database, and its representation is returned to the user. Create a Resource Suppose a client submits a form to create a new Resource, or provides a json-ld or binary representation to an entity REST endpoint. The supplied representation is used to create an entity in Drupal. In response to the entity being saved, an event is emitted with supplied representation as the body. The response is then sent back to the client. If using a browser, the client should be redirected to the newly created resource. Meanwhile, Sync will receive the creation event, and ingest the supplied representation in Fedora. Fedora will then emit a creation event. The ID Mapping connector will react, retrieving the Fedora representation and extracting an ID out of the RDF. That ID will be indexed in the ID Mapping microservice. The triple store connector will also react, retrieving RDF and indexing it in the triple store. If the node created was a preservation master, then Alpaca will respond by inspecting the list of derivative generation services bound as extensions on the preservation master in API-X. Each will be invoked, with the new resource getting ingested into Drupal. The process repeats itself again, with new events being emitted for the new entities getting created in Drupal. Sync responds and ingests the derivatives into Fedora. Fedora emits the creation events, but since none are a preservation master, Alpaca does not respond and the cycle is broken. Update a Resource Suppose a client submits a form to update a new Resource, or provides a json-ld or binary representation to an entity REST endpoint. In response to the entity being saved, an event is emitted with supplied representation as the body. The response is then sent back to the client. Meanwhile, Sync will receive the update event, and apply it against the representation in Fedora. Fedora will then emit an update event. The triple store connector will also react, retrieving RDF and indexing it in the triple store. If a binary of a presentation master was updated, then Alpaca will respond by inspecting the list of derivative generation services bound as extensions on the preservation master in API-X. Each will be invoked, with the new resource overwriting its predecessor in Drupal. The process repeats itself again, with new events being emitted for the derivative entities getting updated in Drupal. Sync responds and ingests the derivatives into Fedora. Fedora emits the creation events, but since none are a preservation master, Alpaca does not respond and the cycle is broken. Delete a Resource Suppose a client deletes a resource through the browser or API. In response to the entity being deleted, an event is emitted. The response is then sent back to the client. Meanwhile, Sync will receive the delete event, and remove the corresponding resource in Fedora. The ID Mapping connector will respond to the delete event by removing the resource\u2019s entry. The triple store connector will also respond, deleting all triples with subject of the resource. Content Modeling in Fedora Descriptive metadata will be RDF properties, and a default dcterms descriptive metadata application profile will be created.

It uses RDF mappings, a concept defined by the RDF Module , and exposes them through the REST API at ?_format=jsonld . Background A quick overview of JSON-LD, the RDF module, and the REST API. The JSON-LD Syntax JSON-LD is a syntax which can be used to express RDF (like Turtle, or RDF XML), that is written in JSON, because devs like JSON and it's web-friendly. The JSON-LD syntax was designed for including Linked Data within HTML of web pages (similar to microdata or RDFa). Instead of nesting the RDF predicates within existing HTML tags as RDFa does, JSON-LD lets you put a solid blob of Linked Data inside a <script> tag. JSON-LD can also function as a standalone document, which is how we're using it. RDF (Drupal Module) The RDF Module is part of Drupal Core, but has no official documentation. The RDF Module embeds RDFa, a form of linked data, within the Drupal-generated HTML when you load the web page for a node, media, or taxonomy term. Official line is that this will allow Google to provide \"rich snippets\" such as star-ratings, contact info, and business hours. As an example of Drupal-provided RDFa: <h1 class=\"page-header\"> <span property=\"schema:title\">My cat</span> </h1> The property=\"schema:title\" is markup generated by Drupal's RDF module that identifies the value \"My cat\" as the schema.org title of this page. A node's fields (such as field_tags ) and properties (such as author ) can be mapped to RDF according to a bundle-specific \"mapping\" that is stored within Drupal. In Drupal8-ese, RDF mappings are configuration entities. Drupal doesn't have a good UI for editing RDF mappings, but you can create, read, and update them as YAML files using Drupal's Configuration Synchronization interface (see section below on How to Edit an RDF Mapping).. REST API The pattern of using ?_format= to get a different representation of content is provided by the RESTful Web Services (rest) module. It allows other services to interact with Drupal entities through HTTP requests ( GET , POST , PATCH , and DELETE ). Which operations are allowed, and with what formats (such as xml , json , and jsonld ) is configured at admin/config/services/rest/ . Note that only jsonld uses RDF mappings; the json and xml formats expose a structured object based on how Drupal sees the entity. Access to these alternate formats throught the REST API corresponds to permissions on the entity, so anyone with access content permission can view the JSON-LD version of that content. This is new as of Drupal 8.2 . For more information on interacting with Drupal entities via REST requests, see An Introduction to RESTful Web Services in Drupal 8 . JSON-LD Module Using the RDF mapping configurations provided by the RDF module, the JSON-LD Module exposes the RDF-mapped entity in JSON-LD, through the REST API, at node/[nid]?_format=jsonld (for nodes; for media and terms, at media/[mid]?_format=jsonld and taxonomy/term/[tid]?_format=jsonld ). The JSON-LD module will only work with mappings that include a value under types (which maps to rdf:type - see below, under Structure of an RDF Mapping). The JSON-LD module provides a hook so other modules can alter the entity before it gets mapped. The islandora module uses this hook to trigger any \"Map URI to Predicate\" and \"Alter JSON-LD Type\" reactions that are configured in Contexts. islandora_defaults provides the two Contexts - \"All Media\" and \"Content\" - that configure these to occur on Media and Repository Item nodes. The JSON-LD module adds RDF datatypes to the RDF values, and includes a mapping of Drupal field types to RDF datatypes. The JSON-LD module provides a hook to alter its Drupal field type to RDF datatype mapping. The JSON-LD module has a configuration option that can cause the ?_format=jsonld to be part of, or not part of, the URIs of Drupal objects. On an out-of-the-box islandora-playbook, this string is stripped, but by default on a fresh install of the jsonld module, it is not. RDF Mappings In an out-of-the-box islandora-playbook, the RDF mappings that exist were loaded from config files, and correspond to the rdf.mapping.[...].yml files located in: [drupal modules directory]/islandora/modules/islandora_core_feature/config/install/ (media and taxonomy terms) [drupal modules directory]/islandora_defaults/config/install/ ( repository_item and the islandora_access vocabulary) [drupal modules directory]/controlled_access_terms/modules/controlled_access_terms_defaults/config/install/ (the default corporate_body , family , geo_location , person , resource_type and subject vocabularies) [drupal web root]/core/profiles/standard/config/install/ (articles, pages, comments, and tags). Once loaded by modules, configuration .yml files are not live so editing them will not change the existing configuration . However, for modules that are Features, it is possible to re-import the changed configuration files at admin/config/development/features (todo: link to further reading on Features). How to edit an RDF Mapping Once loaded, RDF mappings can be customized for the needs of a particular site through Drupal's Configuration Synchronization UI at admin/config/development/configuration . They can be exported, modified, and re-imported one-at-a-time by choosing the \"Single Item\" option on the Export/Import tabs. You can also create new RDF mappings (e.g. for a custom content type) and load them through this interface, by copying an existing mapping and changing the appropriate values. Contributed module for RDF Mappings A custom module rdfui exists, and is installed-but-not-enabled on boxes provisioned by the islandora-playbook. We don't use it because it is very rudimentary and limited to the schema.org vocabulary. We have an open ticket to develop a UI to support RDF mappings to any ontology. Contributions welcome. A number of namespaces such as ldp , ebucore , pcdm , are premis are registered in islandora.module using hook_rdf_namespaces() . To register your own namespaces, you will need to create a custom module that implements that hook. If you import a configuration that uses a namespace that is not registered, bad things will happen silently. Structure of an RDF Mapping Below is an example of an RDF mapping as a .yml (YAML) file. It is the current version of the RDF mapping of the Repository Item ( islandora_object ) bundle, provided by islandora_defaults and exportable as rdf.mapping.node.islandora_object.yml ). The top level key types specifies the rdf:type of the resource or content model. field_model , a required field of Islandora objects, also gets mapped to rdf:type through an arcane back-end process. The top level key fieldMappings specifies fields attached to that bundle and their RDF property mappings. One field can be mapped to more than one RDF property. It is a simple flat list. datatype_callback : [needs documentation] mapping_type: rel : [needs documentation] Sample RDF Mapping langcode: en status: true dependencies: config: - node.type.islandora_object enforced: module: - islandora_defaults module: - node id: node.islandora_object targetEntityType: node bundle: islandora_object types: - 'pcdm:Object' fieldMappings: field_alternative_title: properties: - 'dc:alternative' field_edtf_date: properties: - 'dc:date' datatype_callback: callable: 'Drupal\\controlled_access_terms\\EDTFConverter::dateIso8601Value' field_edtf_date_created: properties: - 'dc:created' datatype_callback: callable: 'Drupal\\controlled_access_terms\\EDTFConverter::dateIso8601Value' field_edtf_date_issued: properties: - 'dc:issued' datatype_callback: callable: 'Drupal\\controlled_access_terms\\EDTFConverter::dateIso8601Value' field_description: properties: - 'dc:description' field_extent: properties: - 'dc:extent' field_identifier: properties: - 'dc:identifier' field_member_of: properties: - 'pcdm:memberOf' mapping_type: rel field_resource_type: properties: - 'dc:type' mapping_type: rel field_rights: properties: - 'dc:rights' field_subject: properties: - 'dc:subject' mapping_type: rel field_weight: properties: - 'co:index' title: properties: - 'dc:title' created: properties: - 'schema:dateCreated' datatype_callback: callable: 'Drupal\\rdf\\CommonDataConverter::dateIso8601Value' changed: properties: - 'schema:dateModified' datatype_callback: callable: 'Drupal\\rdf\\CommonDataConverter::dateIso8601Value' uid: properties: - 'schema:author' mapping_type: rel Sample JSON-LD { \"@graph\":[ { \"@id\":\"http:\\/\\/future.islandora.ca\\/node\\/8\", \"@type\":[ \"http:\\/\\/pcdm.org\\/models#Object\" ], \"http:\\/\\/purl.org\\/dc\\/terms\\/title\":[ { \"@value\":\"lasmomias de uninpahu\", \"@language\":\"fa\" } ], \"http:\\/\\/schema.org\\/author\":[ { \"@id\":\"http:\\/\\/future.islandora.ca\\/en\\/user\\/1\" } ], \"http:\\/\\/schema.org\\/dateCreated\":[ { \"@value\":\"2019-06-04T14:32:05+00:00\", \"@type\":\"http:\\/\\/www.w3.org\\/2001\\/XMLSchema#dateTime\" } ], \"http:\\/\\/schema.org\\/dateModified\":[ { \"@value\":\"2019-06-04T17:02:51+00:00\", \"@type\":\"http:\\/\\/www.w3.org\\/2001\\/XMLSchema#dateTime\" } ], \"http:\\/\\/purl.org\\/dc\\/terms\\/description\":[ { \"@value\":\"mpermmbklmh\", \"@language\":\"fa\" } ], \"http:\\/\\/purl.org\\/dc\\/terms\\/created\":[ { \"@value\":\"2015-10-15\", \"@type\":\"http:\\/\\/www.w3.org\\/2001\\/XMLSchema#string\" }, { \"@value\":\"2015-10-15\", \"@type\":\"http:\\/\\/www.w3.org\\/2001\\/XMLSchema#date\" } ], \"http:\\/\\/purl.org\\/dc\\/terms\\/extent\":[ { \"@value\":\"1 item\", \"@type\":\"http:\\/\\/www.w3.org\\/2001\\/XMLSchema#string\" } ], \"http:\\/\\/pcdm.org\\/models#memberOf\":[ { \"@id\":\"http:\\/\\/future.islandora.ca\\/node\\/7\" } ], \"http:\\/\\/purl.org\\/dc\\/terms\\/type\":[ { \"@id\":\"http:\\/\\/future.islandora.ca\\/taxonomy\\/term\\/3\" } ], \"http:\\/\\/purl.org\\/dc\\/terms\\/subject\":[ { \"@id\":\"http:\\/\\/future.islandora.ca\\/taxonomy\\/term\\/27\" } ] }, { \"@id\":\"http:\\/\\/future.islandora.ca\\/en\\/user\\/1\", \"@type\":[ \"http:\\/\\/schema.org\\/Person\" ] }, { \"@id\":\"http:\\/\\/future.islandora.ca\\/node\\/7\", \"@type\":[ \"http:\\/\\/pcdm.org\\/models#Object\" ] }, { \"@id\":\"http:\\/\\/future.islandora.ca\\/taxonomy\\/term\\/3\", \"@type\":[ \"http:\\/\\/schema.org\\/Thing\" ] }, { \"@id\":\"http:\\/\\/future.islandora.ca\\/taxonomy\\/term\\/27\", \"@type\":[ \"http:\\/\\/schema.org\\/Thing\" ] } ] }","title":"RDF Generation"},{"location":"islandora/rdf-mapping/#rdf-generation","text":"","title":"RDF Generation"},{"location":"islandora/rdf-mapping/#summary","text":"In Islandora, the JSON-LD Module transforms nodes (or media, or taxonomy terms) into the RDF that is synced into Fedora and the Triplestore.

As an example of Drupal-provided RDFa: <h1 class=\"page-header\"> <span property=\"schema:title\">My cat</span> </h1> The property=\"schema:title\" is markup generated by Drupal's RDF module that identifies the value \"My cat\" as the schema.org title of this page. A node's fields (such as field_tags ) and properties (such as author ) can be mapped to RDF according to a bundle-specific \"mapping\" that is stored within Drupal.

Background \" Flysystem is a filesystem abstraction library for PHP\" which allows applications to read from and write to a variety of data source beyond the local file system, such as an SFTP server , Amazon S3 , and Zip files provided an Adapter is available to support it. Flysystem Adapters extend a single class implementing League\\Flysystem\\FilesystemInterface although some separate adapter traits for common actions and properties, such as the StreamedCopyTrait, are available. The Drupal Flysystem module extends Flysystem to work within the Drupal filesystem structure. Drupal flysystem plugins include a Flysystem adapter (if not provided by default or in another library) and a class implementing Drupal\\flysystem\\Plugin\\FlysystemPluginInterface which instantiates the Flysystem adapter based on the Drupal site's configuration. The Drupal Flysystem module uses flysystem stream wrappers to define filesystem descriptors which are configured in the site's settings.php file. The configurations including the filesystem prefix, adapter (driver), and any adapter-specific configurations such as API endpoints and authorization information. Islandora's Implementation The Plugin and Adapter Islandora 8 implements a Flysystem adapter and a Drupal Flysystem plugin . The Flysystem adapter acts as an intermediary between the Flysystem filesystem API and Fedora, translating requests and responses between them. The adapter interacts with Fedora using an instance of the Chullo Fedora API it receives from the Drupal Flysystem plugin. The Drupal Flysystem plugin's main responsibility is to instantiate the Chullo Fedora API object with the proper authentication and pass it to the Flysystem adapter. To authenticate with Fedora the plugin adds a handler to the Chullo's Guzzle client which adds a JWT authentication header to each request. The Fedora Flysystem adapter does not use Gemini to map the relationship between Drupal URIs and Fedora URIs, so they are indexed separately using the \"files_in_fedora\" Context which triggers the \"Index Fedora File in Gemini\" and \"Delete Fedora File in Gemini\" actions as appropriate. Configuration The fedora file system is configured in the site's settings.php file. An example configuration can be seen in the claw-playbook web server role's drupal tasks : $settings['flysystem'] = [ 'fedora' => [ 'driver' => 'fedora', 'config' => [ 'root' => 'http://localhost:8080/fcrepo/rest/', ], ], ]; The configuration array's top-level key is the name of the Drupal stream wrapper, which also serves as the filesystem prefix. Any Drupal file path using \"fedora://\" will use this Flysystem adapter. Drupal will translate this prefix to the site's domain plus \"_flystem/fedora/\". For example, using the default configuration provided by the claw-playbook, a file stored at \"fedora://test.tif\" will persist to Fedora with the URI \"http://localhost:8080/fcrepo/rest/test.tif\" and will be accessible from the Drupal URL \"http://localhost:8000/_flysystem/fedora/test.tif\". The 'driver' value 'fedora' corresponds to the plugin's machine name . The 'config' section contains all the adapter-specific configurations. In this case, the only thing configured for the site is the Fedora REST end-point. (Change this value to match your own Fedora's location, if needed.) The JWT is configured separately. Other examples of Drupal Flysystem configurations can be seen in the module's README . Islandora is configured to have all Media use the Fedora file system by default in the islandora_core_feature. For example, the field storage uri_scheme setting for field_media_image (and the other media types) is \"fedora\". This can also be viewed in the UI on the field's \"Field settings\" page; e.g. http://localhost:8000/admin/structure/media/manage/image/fields/media.image.field_media_image/storage , look for \"Upload destination\" and see that \"Flysystem: fedora\" is selected. However, there are methods for saving files that can explicitly set a different filesystem than the default. Migrations can explicitly set which file system a file is saved to and Islandora can emit events that also specify which file system a derivative should be saved to. Derivatives As hinted in the previous section, Islandora, by default saves derivatives to the Drupal public file system. For example, if I upload a Tiff to a repository item as a File Media with the term \"Original File\", the \"Image Original File\" ( image_original_file ) Context is triggered. This fires the 'image_generate_a_service_file_from_an_original_file' action which emits an event using the 'public' scheme (file system) . To make Islandora save future derivatives to Fedora instead of to Drupal, change the corresponding action's \"File system\" setting ('scheme' in the corresponding config file) to 'fedora' instead of 'public'.","title":"Flysystem"},{"location":"technical-documentation/flysystem/#flysystem","text":"Islandora uses Flysystem and the associated Drupal module to persist binary files to Fedora instead of keeping a copy in both Drupal and Fedora.","title":"Flysystem"},{"location":"technical-documentation/flysystem/#background","text":"\" Flysystem is a filesystem abstraction library for PHP\" which allows applications to read from and write to a variety of data source beyond the local file system, such as an SFTP server , Amazon S3 , and Zip files provided an Adapter is available to support it.

Whether you will eventually use CSVs or other sources (such as XML or directly from a 7.x Islandora) this tutorial should be useful as it covers the basics and mechanics of migration. This tutorial uses the configurations and code available in the migrate_islandora_csv module which, when enabled, will create three example migrations ready for you to use with the Migrate API. Each migration comes from one of the files in the config/install folder. We'll walk through them in detail below. The module is also uses Features which allows you to make changes to the configuration files and sync those changes into your Drupal site. A note on using Features This tutorial (and Islandora in general) makes heavy use of Features, which is an easy way to ship and install Drupal configuration. However, after enabling a Feature module, the code in that module's directory is no longer \"live\", as the configuration now resides in the Drupal database. If you change code in the YAML files, it will not take effect until you re-import the Feature. There is a walkthrough in the \"Configuration\" section of the Migrate 7.x to 8 tutorial. Sample CSV and images are also included in the module as a convenience so they are easily available on the Drupal server running the migration. (This is not the recommended method for making files available to Drupal in a real migration.) The module also contains a Migrate process plugin that transforms strings into associative arrays. This is useful for populating multiple Linked Agent fields. (See \" Typed Relation \" for more information on the Linked Agent field.) It will be available when this module is enabled, and the node migration uses it. It was written generically and will hopefully become part of Migrate Plus, but for now it is here. When you are ready to create your actual migrations, the contents of this repository can function as a template for you to create the YAML files defining your own migrations. Introduction Why CSV? CSV files (whether separated by commas, tabs, or other delimiters) are easy to understand and work with, and there's good tooling available for using them with Drupal 8's Migrate API . The Drupal contrib module migrate_source_csv provides a source plugin that reads from a CSV file, and migrate_plus provides more tools and flexibility for creating migrations, including the ability to create customized migrations using YAML and package them up as Features . In this tutorial, we'll be inspecting each migration file in detail before running it. You'll start out by migrating the images themselves first, and then you'll create various Drupal entities to describe the files from the metadata in the CSV. It's not as scary as it sounds (especially since this module contains the data we'll be using in a data directory), but you will need a few things before beginning: An instance of Islandora 8. Use Islandora 8 playbook to spin up an environment pre-loaded with all the modules you need (except this one) Some basic command line skills. You won't need to know much, but you'll have to vagrant ssh into the box, navigate into Drupal, and use git and drush , etc... If you can copy/paste into a terminal, you'll survive. A big part of this tutorial relies on the islandora_defaults and controlled_access_terms_defaults features, which define the default metadata profile for Islandora (which we'll be migrating into). You're not required to use the islandora_defaults or controlled_access_terms_defaults for your repository, but for the purposes of demonstration, it saves you a lot of user interface administrivia so you can focus just on the learning how to migrate. By the time you are done with this exercise, you'll be able to easily apply your knowledge to migrate using any custom metadata profile you can build using Drupal. Overview The Migrate API is the main way to ingest batches of data into Drupal (and because Islandora 8 is Drupal, into Islandora). The Migrate module only provides the framework, it's up to you to create the rules that take data from a source , through a process (i.e. a mapping) to a destination . A set of these rules is called a \"migration\". It has to be set up (as a Configuration Entity, either by importing a YAML file or by installing a Feature) and then it has to be run. Once a migration has been run, it will have created (or updated) a bunch of Drupal entities of one type - whether that's taxonomy terms, nodes, files, etc. Since an Object in Islandora 8 is made up of several different Drupal entities that refer to each other, it's going to take multiple migrations to create an Islandora object, and it's important to perform these migrations in a sensible order. A basic Islandora object is at minimum: - a file, which holds the actual binary contents of an item - a node, which holds the descriptive metadata for an item and makes it discoverable - a media, which holds technical metadata and references the file and the node, linking the two together. Therefore, each row in your CSV must contain enough information to create these. Using multiple sources for object components While this tutorial uses a single CSV to describe all the parts of an islandora object, a site can use multiple sources (CSV or otherwise) to migrate the various parts. The only requirements then is to have keys in place matching the parts together. For example, a 'files.csv' can use paths that serve as file identifiers and 'metadata.csv' can use an object identifier. As long as the source for the media migration has the key values for the file and metadata migrations (the file paths and object identifiers, respectively, in this example), we can create the necessary links between the object's components. This is very useful when you need to migrate multiple media/file pairs associated with a single node, such as pre-processed derivatives that need to be migrated. Buried in your descriptive metadata are often references to other things which aren't repository items themselves, but records still need to be kept for them. Authors, publishers, universities, places, etc... can be modeled as Drupal Entities, so that they can be referenced by other Entities. So there's the potential to have a lot of different entity types described in a single row in a CSV. In this tutorial, we're working with islandora_defaults and controlled_access_terms entities, and will be migrating six entity types using the three migrations included in this module. - file - node - media - subject - person - corporate_body We can do this because subjects, persons, and corporate bodies are (in this example) represented by simple 'name' strings. We create them on the fly, as if we were adding new tags to a tag vocabulary. If we wanted to model subjects, people, or corporate bodies as entities with multiple fields (first name, last name, date, subheadings, URI, etc.) then we would need up to six migrations. Migrations follow the Extract-Transform-Load pattern . You extract the information from a source, process the data to transform it into the format you need, and load it into the destination system (i.e. Drupal). Migrations are stored in Drupal as configuration, which means they can be represented in YAML, transferred to and from different sites, and are compatible with Drupal's configuration synchronization tools. And the structure of each YAML file is arranged to follow the Extract-Transform-Load pattern. To perform the migrations, we'll be using drush . We will be able to run each of the file, node, and media migrations separately or all at once in a group. We will also learn how to roll back a migration in case it didn't go as planned. The sample migrations here will give us a chance to show off some techniques for working with multi-valued fields, entity reference fields, and complex field types like controlled_access_terms 's typed_relation field. We'll also see how the migrate framework can help de-duplicate, and at the same time, linked data-ize :tm: your data by looking up previously migrated entities. So hold on to your hats. First, let's get this module onto your Islandora instance. Installation From your islandora-playbook directory, issue the following commands to enable this module: - vagrant ssh to open a shell in your Islandora instance. - cd /var/www/html/drupal/web/modules/contrib to get to your modules directory. - git clone https://github.com/islandora/migrate_islandora_csv to clone down the repository from GitHub. - drush en -y migrate_islandora_csv to enable the module, installing the migrations as configuration. Optionally, flush the cache ( drush cr ), so the migrations become visible in the GUI at Manage > Structure > Migrations > migrate_islandora_csv (http://localhost:8000/admin/structure/migrate/manage/migrate_islandora_csv/migrations) Now lets go migrate some files. Caution As you saw, you can git clone into the modules directory, but if you're installing a custom module that's intended to stay installed for the long term (unlike a migration feature, which you should probably uninstall and delete when you're done with it) then you may want to check with your devops folks and use Composer instead. However, using Git directly allows you to be more flexible when iterating and testing. Ingesting Files To migrate files (i.e. just the raw binaries) from a CSV, you need: * a column in the CSV containing paths to the files you wish to ingest, and * the files need to be accessible from the server that's running Drupal so that the Migrate framework can find them. This tutorial assumes you're working with the sample images provided in the module, which will be located at /var/www/html/drupal/web/modules/contrib/migrate_islandora_csv/data/images . When you're migrating for real, the files will have to be uploaded or otherwise made accessible to the server before this point. Open up the CSV file at data/migration.csv and you'll see a file column containing paths to the sample images. You can use your favorite shell-based utility to open it at /var/www/html/drupal/web/modules/contrib/migrate_islandora_csv/data/migration.csv , or browse to it on GitHub, or just look at it pasted below as this tutorial does not require you to edit the files. file /var/www/html/drupal/web/modules/contrib/migrate_islandora_csv/data/images/Nails Nails Nails.jpg /var/www/html/drupal/web/modules/contrib/migrate_islandora_csv/data/images/Free Smells.jpg /var/www/html/drupal/web/modules/contrib/migrate_islandora_csv/data/images/Nothing to See Here.jpg /var/www/html/drupal/web/modules/contrib/migrate_islandora_csv/data/images/Call For Champagne.jpg /var/www/html/drupal/web/modules/contrib/migrate_islandora_csv/data/images/This Must Be The Place.jpg Open up the \"files\" migration at config/install/migrate_plus.migration.file.yml .

They always contain core identification information and three key sections: source , process , and destination . And these sections correspond exactly to Extract, Transform, and Load. Identification The first section of a migration contains metadata for Drupal about the migration itself. The id parameter is the machine name of this migration, and must not conflict with existing migrations. Note: use alphanumeric characters and underscores. Hyphens (-) will cause the migration to fail. The label is a human-readable string to identify this migration, and the migration_group is where this migration will be grouped in the GUI. Source The source section configures a Drupal source plugin that will extract the data. A source plugin provides \"rows\" of data to processing plugins so that they can be worked on. In this case, we're using the csv source plugin, which very literally uses rows, however you can have source plugins that work with other data formats like XML and JSON. Look at the config from this section. source: plugin: csv path: '/var/www/html/drupal/web/modules/contrib/migrate_islandora_csv/data/migration.csv' delimiter: ',' header_row_count: 1 keys: - file constants: destination_dir: 'fedora://csv_migration' You can see we provide a path to its location, what delimiter to use, if it uses a header row, and which column contains a unique key for each entry. Constants can also be defined here (more on those later). Process We're going to dive into the details of this step below, but in summary: the process section is where we extract the desired bits from that row, transform them as desired, and populate them into an associative array. This section is a series of named steps, that call one or more process plugins. These plugins are executed in sequence, with the results getting passed from one to the next, forming a pipeline. By the end of the step, you have transformed some element of data (perhaps through text manipulation, concatenation, etc...) into the form that Drupal is expecting. The resulting value gets associated with the name of the step. If the name of a step is the same as a field or property name on the target entity, the migrated entity will have that value for that field or property. This is how you can apply metadata from the CSV to an entity. If the step name is not the name of a field or property on the target entity, the migrate framework assumes it's a temporary value you're using as part of more complex logic. It won't wind up on the entity when the migration is done, but it will be available for you to use within other process plugins. You can always spot when a temporary value is being used by the fact that it's prefixed with an @ and surrounded by quotes. You can also pass constants into process plugins, which are prefixed with constants/ . Destination The destination section contains the configuration that describes what gets loaded into Drupal. destination: plugin: 'entity:file' type: image You can create any type of content entity in Drupal. In this case, we're making file entities. Specifically, we're making images, which are a special type of file entity that's provided by core Drupal. The Process Section in Depth In the process section of the migration, we're copying the images over into a Drupal file system and setting the uri property on the corresponding File entity. uri: plugin: file_copy source: - file - '@destination' To do this, we're using the file_copy process plugin. But first, we have to know where a file is located and where it should be copied to. We know where the file resides, we have that in the CSV's file column. But we're going to have to do some string manipulation in order to generate the new location where we want the file copied. We're trying to convert something like /var/www/html/drupal/web/modules/contrib/migrate_islandora_csv/data/images/Free Smells.jpg to fedora://csv_migration/Free Smells.jpg . The URI we're constructing is a stream wrapper of the form scheme://path/to/file . Islandora uses Flysystem , which allows for integration with many different types of filesystems, both remote and local. With Flysystem , the scheme part of the URI is the name of a filesystem. By default, Fedora is exposed using the scheme fedora:// . So by setting uri to fedora://csv_migration/Free Smells.jpg , we're saying \"put Free Smells.jpg in the csv_migration directory in Fedora.\" Now, to perform this string manipulation in PHP, we'd do something like $info = pathinfo($filepath); $filename = $info['basename']; $destination = \"fedora://csv_migration/\" . $filename; We will mimic this exactly in the process section of our migration config. Just like we declare variables and call functions with PHP code, we can make entries in the process section to store the output of Drupal process plugins. We'll build up a destination \"variable\" using a filename \"variable\" and pass it into the file_copy process plugin. To start, we'll get the filename using two process plugins, which do the same steps as the first two lines of the PHP above: filename: - plugin: callback callable: pathinfo source: file - plugin: extract index: - basename The first process plugin, callback , lets you execute any PHP function that takes a single input and returns an output. It's not as flexible as making your own custom process plugin, but it's still pretty useful in a lot of situations. Here we're using it to call pathinfo() , telling it to use the file column in the CSV as input. We pass the resulting array from pathinfo() to the extract process plugin, which pulls data out of arrays using the keys you provide it under index . Now that we have the file name, we have to prepend it with fedora://csv_migration/ to make the destination URI. In our PHP code above, we used . to concatenate the strings. In the migration framework, we use the concat process plugin. You provide it with two or more strings to concatenate, as well as a delimiter. destination: plugin: concat delimiter: / source: - constants/destination_dir - '@filename' In our PHP code, we concatenated the $filename variable with a string literal. In our process plugin, we can provide the variable, e.g. the output of the filename process step, by prefixing it with an @ . We can't, however, pass in fedora://csv_migration directly as a string. At first glance, you might think something like this would work, but it totally doesn't: # Can't do this. Won't work at all. destination: plugin: concat delimiter: / source: - 'fedora://csv_migration' - '@filename' That's because the migrate framework only interprets source values as names of columns from the CSV or names of other process steps. Even if they're wrapped in quotes. It will never try to use the string directly as a value. To circumvent this, we declare a constant in the source section of the migration config. constants: destination_dir: 'fedora://csv_migration' This constant can be referenced as constants/destination_dir and passed into the concat process plugin as a source . There are a lot more process plugins available through the (core) Migrate and Migrate Plus modules, and they are documented on Drupal.org . Running the File Migration Migrations can be executed via drush using the migrate:import command. You specify which migration to run by using the id defined in its YAML. You also need to set parameters to tell Drush who you are and what your site's URL is. Failing to do so will result in derivatives not being generated and malformed/improper RDF. So don't forget them! To run the file migration from the command line, make sure you're within /var/www/html/drupal/web (or any subdirectory) and enter drush -y --userid=1 --uri=localhost:8000 migrate:import file If you've already run the migration before, but want to re-run it for any reason, use the --update flag. drush -y --userid=1 --uri=localhost:8000 migrate:import file --update You may have noticed that migrations can be grouped, and that they define a migration_group in their configuration. You can execute an entire group of migrations using the --group flag. For example, to run the entire group defined in this module drush -y --userid=1 --uri=localhost:8000 migrate:import --group migrate_islandora_csv You can also use the migrate:rollback command to delete all migrated entities. Like migrate:import , it also respects the --group flag and --uri parameter. So to rollback everything we just did: drush -y --uri=localhost:8000 migrate:rollback --group migrate_islandora_csv If something goes bad during development, sometimes migrations can get stuck in a bad state. Use the migrate:reset command to put a migration back to Idle . For example, with the file migration, use drush -y --uri=localhost:8000 migrate:reset file Make sure you've run (and not rolled back) the file migration. It should tell you that it successfully created 5 files. You can confirm its success by visiting http://localhost:8000/admin/content/files. You should see 5 images of neon signs in the list. Ingesting Nodes Those five images are nice, but we need something to hold their descriptive metadata and show them off. We use nodes in Drupal to do this, and that means we have another migration file to work with. Nestled in with our nodes' descriptive metadata, though, are more Drupal entities, and we're going to generate them on the fly while we're making nodes. While we're doing it, we'll see how to use pipe delimited strings for multiple values as well as how to handle typed_relation fields that are provided by controlled_access_terms . Open up /var/www/html/drupal/web/modules/contrib/migrate_islandora_csv/config/install/migrate_plus.migration.node.yml and check it out. # Uninstall this config when the feature is uninstalled dependencies: enforced: module: - migrate_islandora_csv id: node label: Import Nodes from CSV migration_group: migrate_islandora_csv source: plugin: csv path: modules/contrib/migrate_islandora_csv/data/migration.csv # 1 means you have a header row, 0 means you don't header_row_count: 1 # Each migration needs a unique key per row in the csv.

If values contained special characters such as colons, quotes would be needed. If you look at the process section, you can see we're taking the title , description , and issued columns from the CSV and applying them directly to the migrated nodes without any manipulation. title: title field_description: description field_edtf_date: issued For subtitle , we're passing it through the skip_on_empty process plugin because not every row in our CSV has a subtitle entry. It's very useful when you have spotty data, and you'll end up using it a lot. The method: process bit tells the migrate framework only skip that particular field if the value is empty, and not to skip the whole row. It's important, so don't forget it. The full YAML for setting field_alternative_title from subtitle looks like this: field_alternative_title: plugin: skip_on_empty source: subtitle method: process Now here's where things get interesting. We can look up other entities to populate entity reference fields. For example, all Repository Items have an entity reference field that holds a taxonomy term from the islandora_models vocabulary. All of our examples are images, so we'll look up the Image model in the vocabulary since it already exists (it gets made for you when you use islandora-playbook). We use the entity_lookup process plugin to do this. field_model: plugin: entity_lookup source: constants/model entity_type: taxonomy_term # 'name' is the string value of the term, e.g. 'Original file', 'Thumbnail'. value_key: name bundle_key: vid bundle: islandora_models The entity_lookup process plugin looks up an entity based on the configuration you give it. You use the entity_type , bundle_key , and bundle configurations to limit which entities you search through. entity_type is, as you'd suspect, the type of entity: node, media, file, taxonomy_term, etc... bundle_key tells the migrate framework which property holds the bundle of the entity, and bundle is the actual bundle id you want to restrict by. In this case we specify the vid (vocabulary id) has to be islandora_models - which is the machine name of the vocabulary we're interested in. In this plugin, source is the value to search for - in this case we're looking for the string \"Image\", which we've defined as a constant. And we're comparing it to the name field on each term by setting the value_key config. This approach applies the same taxonomy term to all objects. If you want to assign a taxonomy term at the node level (that is, potentially a different term for each node) rather than to all the nodes being imported, you can use a configuration as illustrated next. In this example, we have a column in our CSV input file with the header 'model', which we define as the source of the field_model values: field_model: plugin: entity_lookup # 'model' is the header of a field in our input CSV that contains the string value of the taxonomy term. source: model entity_type: taxonomy_term value_key: name bundle_key: vid bundle: islandora_models If you're not sure that the entities you're looking up already exist, you can use the entity_generate plugin, which takes the same config, but will create a new entity if the lookup fails. We use this plugin to create subject taxonomy terms that we tag our nodes with. A node can have multiple subjects, so we've encoded them in the CSV as pipe delimited strings. subject Neon signs|Night Neon signs|Night|Funny Neon signs|Night Drinking|Neon signs Neon signs We can hack those apart easily enough. In PHP we'd do something like $subjects = explode($string, '|'); $terms = []; foreach ($subjects as $name) { $terms[] = \\Drupal::service('entity_type.manager')->getStorage('taxonomy_term')->create([ ... 'vid' => 'subject', 'name' => $name, ... ]); } $node->set('field_subject', $terms); With process plugins, that logic looks like field_subject: - plugin: skip_on_empty source: subject method: process - plugin: explode delimiter: '|' - plugin: entity_generate entity_type: taxonomy_term value_key: name bundle_key: vid bundle: subject Here we've got a small pipeline that uses the skip_on_empty process plugin, which we've already seen, followed by explode . The explode process plugin operates exactly like its PHP counterpart, taking an array and a delimiter as input. The combination of skip_on_empty and explode behave like a foreach loop on the explode results. If we have an empty string, nothing happens. If there's one or more pipe delimited subject names in the string, then entity_generate gets called for each name that's found. The entity_generate process plugin will try to look up a subject by name, and if that fails, it creates one using the name and saves a reference to it in the node. So entity_generate is actually smarter than our pseudo-code above, because it can be run over and over again and it won't duplicate entities. :champagne: Complex Fields Some fields don't hold just a single type of value. In other words, not everything is just text, numbers, or references. Using Drupal 8's Typed Data API , fields can hold groups of named values with different types. Consider a field that holds an RGB color. You could set it with PHP like so: $node->set('field_color', ['R' => 255, 'G' => 255, 'B' => 255]); You could even have a multi-valued color field, and do something like this $node->set('field_color', [ ['R' => 0, 'G' => 0, 'B' => 0], ['R' => 255, 'G' => 255, 'B' => 255], ]); In the migrate framework, you have two options for handling these types of fields. You can build up the full array they're expecting, which is difficult and requires a custom process plugin. Or, if you only have one value going into a complex field, you can set each named component in the field with separate process pipelines. In controlled_access_terms , we define a new field type of typed_relation , which is an entity reference coupled with a MARC relator. It expects an associative array that looks like this: [ 'target_id' => 1, 'rel_type' => 'relators:ctb'] The target_id portion takes an entity id, and rel_type takes the predicate for the MARC relator we want to use to describe the relationship the entity has with the repository item. This example would reference taxonomy_term 1 and give it the relator for \"Contributor\". If we have a single name to deal with, we can set those values in YAML, accessing field_linked_agent/target_id and field_linked_agent/rel_type independently. field_linked_agent/target_id: plugin: entity_generate source: photographer entity_type: taxonomy_term value_key: name bundle_key: vid bundle: person field_linked_agent/rel_type: constants/relator Here we're looking at the photographer column in the CSV, which contains the names of the photographers that captured these images. Since we know these are photographers, and not publishers or editors, we can bake in the relator constant we set to relators:pht in the source section of the migration. So all that's left to do is to set the taxonomy term's id via entity_generate . If the lookup succeeds, the id is returned. If it fails, a term is created and its id is returned. In the end, by using the / syntax to set properties on complex fields, everything gets wrapped up into that nice associative array structure for you automatically. However, if you have multiple names, and/or multiple columns that contain values that will go into the same typed_relation field, you do need to build up a full array of structured data. We start by extracting the values in the photographer column, and busting them into a list. (In this case, given the sample data, the lists will all have length 1). Then, we use a custom process plugin to make each value the value in an associative array (see example data below). photographers: - source: photographer plugin: skip_on_empty method: process - plugin: explode delimiter: '|' - plugin: str_to_assoc key: 'name' So, if we started with a column containing 'Alice|Bob|Charlie' at the end of this pipeline, the photographers temporary variable would contain [ ['name' => 'Alice'], ['name' => 'Bob'], ['name' => 'Charlie] ] Next, we use the sub_process plugin. It takes an array of associative arrays (as seen above) and iterates over them. From within subprocess' process parameter, you can access only what's defined in that associative array. Here, when we do our entity_generate lookup, our source is name , the (only) key in that array. linked_agent_pht: plugin: sub_process source: '@photographers' process: target_id: plugin: entity_generate source: name entity_type: taxonomy_term value_key: name bundle_key: vid bundle: person rel_type: plugin: default_value default_value: 'relators:pht' Within sub_process , we cannot access the temporary variables or constants that we've created in the outer migration. This is why we use the default_value plugin when for the rel_type . It would have been simpler to define a constant as we did with 'Image', but we wouldn't be able to access it. The output of this pipeline is now formatted as the structured data expected by a typed_relation field: [ ['target_id' => 42, 'rel_type' => 'relators:pht' ], ['target_id' => 43, 'rel_type' => 'relators:pht' ], ['target_id' => 44, 'rel_type' => 'relators:pht' ], ] The final step will be to assign this array to the Linked Agent field. But first, we repeat the process for another column, which contains names that have a different relator, and a different bundle. Finally, we merge the two temporary variables and pass the result to field_linked_agent . We don't have to assign the sub-components of field_linked_agent here, because this is already the structured data it is looking for. field_linked_agent: plugin: merge source: - '@linked_agent_pht' - '@linked_agent_prv' Clear as mud? Great. Now let's run that migration. Running the node migration Like with the file migration, run drush -y --userid=1 --uri=http://localhost:8000 migrate:import node from anywhere within the Drupal installation directory will fire off the migration. Go to http://localhost:8000/admin/content and you should see five new nodes. Click on one, though, and you'll see it's just a stub with metadata. The CSV metadata is there, links to other entities like subjects and photographers are there, but there's no trace of the corresponding files. Here's where media entities come into play. Migrating Media Media entities are Drupal's solution for fieldable files. Since you can't put fields on a file, what you can do is wrap the file with a Media entity. In addition to a reference to the file (binary), technical metadata and structural metadata for the file go on the Media entity (e.g. MIME type, file size, resolution). Media also have a few special fields that are required for Islandora, field_media_of and field_use , which denote what node owns the media and what role the media serves, respectively. Since the Media entity references both the file it wraps and the node that owns it, Media entities act as a bridge between files and nodes, tying them together. And to do this, we make use of one last process plugin, migration_lookup . Open up /var/www/html/drupal/web/modules/contrib/migrate_islandora_csv/config/install/migrate_plus.migration.media.yml and give it a look. # Uninstall this config when the feature is uninstalled dependencies: enforced: module: - migrate_islandora_csv id: media label: Import Media from CSV migration_group: migrate_islandora_csv source: plugin: csv path: modules/contrib/migrate_islandora_csv/data/migration.csv # 1 means you have a header row, 0 means you don't header_row_count: 1 # Each migration needs a unique key per row in the csv. Here we're using the file path. keys: - file # You can't enter string literals into a process plugin, but you can give it a constant as a 'source'. constants: # We're tagging our media as Original Files use: Original File # Everything gets created as admin uid: 1 process: name: title uid: constants/uid # Make the media an 'Original File' field_media_use: plugin: entity_lookup source: constants/use entity_type: taxonomy_term value_key: name bundle_key: vid bundle: islandora_media_use # Lookup the migrated file in the file migration. field_media_image: plugin: migration_lookup source: file migration: file no_stub: true # Lookup the migrated node in the node migration field_media_of: plugin: migration_lookup source: file migration: node no_stub: true destination: # These are 'image' media we're making. plugin: 'entity:media' default_bundle: image migration_dependencies: required: - migrate_plus.migration.file - migrate_plus.migration.node optional: { } The Breakdown Compared to the other migrations, this one is very straightforward. There's no string or array manipulation in YAML, and at most there's only one process plugin per field. Title and user are set directly, with no processing required name: title uid: constants/uid The field_media_use field is a tag that's used to denote the purpose of a file with regard to the node it belongs to. E.g. is this the original file? a lower quality derivative? thumbnail? etc... In many ways it bears a resemblance to DSID in Islandora 7.x. Like field_model with nodes, the vocabulary already exists in your Islandora install, so all you have to do is look it up with the entity_lookup plugin. # Make the media an 'Original File' field_media_use: plugin: entity_lookup source: constants/use entity_type: taxonomy_term value_key: name bundle_key: vid bundle: islandora_media_use The field_media_image and field_media_of fields are how the media binds a file to a node. You could use entity_lookup or entity_generate , but we've already migrated them and can very easily look them up by the id assigned to them during migration. But what's the benefit of doing so? The entity_lookup and entity_generate process plugins do the job fine, right? The main advantage of using migration_lookup and defining migrations whenever possible, is that migrated entities can be rolled back. If you were to hop into your console and execute drush -y --uri=http://localhost:8000 migrate:rollback --group migrate_islandora_csv Your nodes, media, and files would all be gone. But your subjects and photographers would remain. If you want to truly and cleanly roll back every entity in a migration, you need to define those migrations and use migration_lookup to set entity reference fields. Running the media migration Run drush -y --uri=http://localhost:8000 migrate:import media from anywhere within the Drupal installation directory. You should now be able to see the media files attached to the nodes you created earlier. At this point, you might want to create derivatives, such as thumbnails, using the appropriate Drupal actions on the main content admin window. What have we learned? If you've made it all the way to the end here, then you've learned that you can migrate files and CSV metadata into Islandora using only YAML files. You've seen how to transform data with pipelines of processing plugins and can handle numeric, text, and entity reference fields. You can handle multiple values for fields, and even more complicated things like typed_relation fields. And as big as this walkthrough was, we're only scratching the surface of what can be done with the Migrate API. Where to go from here? There's certainly more you can do with Drupal 8's Migrate API. There's a plethora of source and processing plugins out there that can handle pretty much anything you throw at it. XML and JSON are fair game. You can also request sources using HTTP, so you can always point it at an existing systems REST API and go from there. If you can't make the Migrate API's existing workflow make the necessary changes to your data, you can expand its capabilities by writing your own process plugins. Reading the Drupal.org documentation on the Migrate API would be a good place to start. But really the best thing to do is try and get your data into Islandora! We intend to create a boilerplate branch of this repository that will allow you to clone down a migration template, ready for you to customize to fit your data. And as you assemble it into CSV format, keep in mind that if you have more than just names for things like subjects and authors, that you can always make more CSVs. Think of it like maintaining tables in an SQL database. Each CSV has unique keys, so you can lookup/join entities between CSVs using those keys. And you can still pipe-delimit the keys like we did in our example to handle multi-valued fields. In some repositories, these CSVs can be used to make bulk updates to metadata. Just make your changes to maintain the CSVs, then run the migration(s) again with the --update flag. This will not always be efficient, as you'll update every entity, even if it didn't change. But, by breaking down your CSVs per collection or object type, you could keep them small enough to use this process for a small repository. There is also a tool for migrating directly from an Islandora 7.x to Islandora 8 ( migrate_7x_claw ), using Solr, XPaths, and Fedora calls to pull files and objects directly into Islandora 8. It may be worth checking out, and/or using in conjunction with a CSV migration.","title":"CSV"},{"location":"technical-documentation/migrate-csv/#table-of-contents","text":"Summary Introduction Dependencies Overview Installation Ingesting Files Anatomy of a migration Source Process Destination The Process Section in Depth Running the File Migration Ingesting Nodes Complex Fields Running the node migration Migrating Media What have we learned Where to go from here","title":"Table of Contents"},{"location":"technical-documentation/migrate-csv/#summary","text":"This tutorial introduces you to the Drupal 8 Migrate tools available to create Islandora content. Whether you will eventually use CSVs or other sources (such as XML or directly from a 7.x Islandora) this tutorial should be useful as it covers the basics and mechanics of migration. This tutorial uses the configurations and code available in the migrate_islandora_csv module which, when enabled, will create three example migrations ready for you to use with the Migrate API. Each migration comes from one of the files in the config/install folder. We'll walk through them in detail below. The module is also uses Features which allows you to make changes to the configuration files and sync those changes into your Drupal site. A note on using Features This tutorial (and Islandora in general) makes heavy use of Features, which is an easy way to ship and install Drupal configuration. However, after enabling a Feature module, the code in that module's directory is no longer \"live\", as the configuration now resides in the Drupal database. If you change code in the YAML files, it will not take effect until you re-import the Feature. There is a walkthrough in the \"Configuration\" section of the Migrate 7.x to 8 tutorial. Sample CSV and images are also included in the module as a convenience so they are easily available on the Drupal server running the migration. (This is not the recommended method for making files available to Drupal in a real migration.) The module also contains a Migrate process plugin that transforms strings into associative arrays. This is useful for populating multiple Linked Agent fields. (See \" Typed Relation \" for more information on the Linked Agent field.) It will be available when this module is enabled, and the node migration uses it. It was written generically and will hopefully become part of Migrate Plus, but for now it is here. When you are ready to create your actual migrations, the contents of this repository can function as a template for you to create the YAML files defining your own migrations.","title":"Summary"},{"location":"technical-documentation/migrate-csv/#introduction","text":"Why CSV? CSV files (whether separated by commas, tabs, or other delimiters) are easy to understand and work with, and there's good tooling available for using them with Drupal 8's Migrate API . The Drupal contrib module migrate_source_csv provides a source plugin that reads from a CSV file, and migrate_plus provides more tools and flexibility for creating migrations, including the ability to create customized migrations using YAML and package them up as Features . In this tutorial, we'll be inspecting each migration file in detail before running it. You'll start out by migrating the images themselves first, and then you'll create various Drupal entities to describe the files from the metadata in the CSV. It's not as scary as it sounds (especially since this module contains the data we'll be using in a data directory), but you will need a few things before beginning: An instance of Islandora 8. Use Islandora 8 playbook to spin up an environment pre-loaded with all the modules you need (except this one) Some basic command line skills. You won't need to know much, but you'll have to vagrant ssh into the box, navigate into Drupal, and use git and drush , etc... If you can copy/paste into a terminal, you'll survive. A big part of this tutorial relies on the islandora_defaults and controlled_access_terms_defaults features, which define the default metadata profile for Islandora (which we'll be migrating into). You're not required to use the islandora_defaults or controlled_access_terms_defaults for your repository, but for the purposes of demonstration, it saves you a lot of user interface administrivia so you can focus just on the learning how to migrate. By the time you are done with this exercise, you'll be able to easily apply your knowledge to migrate using any custom metadata profile you can build using Drupal.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"technical-documentation/migrate-csv/#overview","text":"The Migrate API is the main way to ingest batches of data into Drupal (and because Islandora 8 is Drupal, into Islandora). The Migrate module only provides the framework, it's up to you to create the rules that take data from a source , through a process (i.e. a mapping) to a destination . A set of these rules is called a \"migration\". It has to be set up (as a Configuration Entity, either by importing a YAML file or by installing a Feature) and then it has to be run. Once a migration has been run, it will have created (or updated) a bunch of Drupal entities of one type - whether that's taxonomy terms, nodes, files, etc. Since an Object in Islandora 8 is made up of several different Drupal entities that refer to each other, it's going to take multiple migrations to create an Islandora object, and it's important to perform these migrations in a sensible order. A basic Islandora object is at minimum: - a file, which holds the actual binary contents of an item - a node, which holds the descriptive metadata for an item and makes it discoverable - a media, which holds technical metadata and references the file and the node, linking the two together. Therefore, each row in your CSV must contain enough information to create these. Using multiple sources for object components While this tutorial uses a single CSV to describe all the parts of an islandora object, a site can use multiple sources (CSV or otherwise) to migrate the various parts. The only requirements then is to have keys in place matching the parts together. For example, a 'files.csv' can use paths that serve as file identifiers and 'metadata.csv' can use an object identifier. As long as the source for the media migration has the key values for the file and metadata migrations (the file paths and object identifiers, respectively, in this example), we can create the necessary links between the object's components. This is very useful when you need to migrate multiple media/file pairs associated with a single node, such as pre-processed derivatives that need to be migrated. Buried in your descriptive metadata are often references to other things which aren't repository items themselves, but records still need to be kept for them. Authors, publishers, universities, places, etc... can be modeled as Drupal Entities, so that they can be referenced by other Entities. So there's the potential to have a lot of different entity types described in a single row in a CSV. In this tutorial, we're working with islandora_defaults and controlled_access_terms entities, and will be migrating six entity types using the three migrations included in this module. - file - node - media - subject - person - corporate_body We can do this because subjects, persons, and corporate bodies are (in this example) represented by simple 'name' strings. We create them on the fly, as if we were adding new tags to a tag vocabulary. If we wanted to model subjects, people, or corporate bodies as entities with multiple fields (first name, last name, date, subheadings, URI, etc.) then we would need up to six migrations. Migrations follow the Extract-Transform-Load pattern . You extract the information from a source, process the data to transform it into the format you need, and load it into the destination system (i.e. Drupal). Migrations are stored in Drupal as configuration, which means they can be represented in YAML, transferred to and from different sites, and are compatible with Drupal's configuration synchronization tools. And the structure of each YAML file is arranged to follow the Extract-Transform-Load pattern. To perform the migrations, we'll be using drush . We will be able to run each of the file, node, and media migrations separately or all at once in a group. We will also learn how to roll back a migration in case it didn't go as planned. The sample migrations here will give us a chance to show off some techniques for working with multi-valued fields, entity reference fields, and complex field types like controlled_access_terms 's typed_relation field. We'll also see how the migrate framework can help de-duplicate, and at the same time, linked data-ize :tm: your data by looking up previously migrated entities. So hold on to your hats. First, let's get this module onto your Islandora instance.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"technical-documentation/migrate-csv/#installation","text":"From your islandora-playbook directory, issue the following commands to enable this module: - vagrant ssh to open a shell in your Islandora instance. - cd /var/www/html/drupal/web/modules/contrib to get to your modules directory. - git clone https://github.com/islandora/migrate_islandora_csv to clone down the repository from GitHub. - drush en -y migrate_islandora_csv to enable the module, installing the migrations as configuration. Optionally, flush the cache ( drush cr ), so the migrations become visible in the GUI at Manage > Structure > Migrations > migrate_islandora_csv (http://localhost:8000/admin/structure/migrate/manage/migrate_islandora_csv/migrations) Now lets go migrate some files. Caution As you saw, you can git clone into the modules directory, but if you're installing a custom module that's intended to stay installed for the long term (unlike a migration feature, which you should probably uninstall and delete when you're done with it) then you may want to check with your devops folks and use Composer instead.

When you're migrating for real, the files will have to be uploaded or otherwise made accessible to the server before this point.

By the end of the step, you have transformed some element of data (perhaps through text manipulation, concatenation, etc...) into the form that Drupal is expecting. The resulting value gets associated with the name of the step. If the name of a step is the same as a field or property name on the target entity, the migrated entity will have that value for that field or property. This is how you can apply metadata from the CSV to an entity. If the step name is not the name of a field or property on the target entity, the migrate framework assumes it's a temporary value you're using as part of more complex logic. It won't wind up on the entity when the migration is done, but it will be available for you to use within other process plugins. You can always spot when a temporary value is being used by the fact that it's prefixed with an @ and surrounded by quotes. You can also pass constants into process plugins, which are prefixed with constants/ .","title":"Process"},{"location":"technical-documentation/migrate-csv/#destination","text":"The destination section contains the configuration that describes what gets loaded into Drupal. destination: plugin: 'entity:file' type: image You can create any type of content entity in Drupal.

But first, we have to know where a file is located and where it should be copied to. We know where the file resides, we have that in the CSV's file column. But we're going to have to do some string manipulation in order to generate the new location where we want the file copied. We're trying to convert something like /var/www/html/drupal/web/modules/contrib/migrate_islandora_csv/data/images/Free Smells.jpg to fedora://csv_migration/Free Smells.jpg . The URI we're constructing is a stream wrapper of the form scheme://path/to/file . Islandora uses Flysystem , which allows for integration with many different types of filesystems, both remote and local. With Flysystem , the scheme part of the URI is the name of a filesystem. By default, Fedora is exposed using the scheme fedora:// . So by setting uri to fedora://csv_migration/Free Smells.jpg , we're saying \"put Free Smells.jpg in the csv_migration directory in Fedora.\" Now, to perform this string manipulation in PHP, we'd do something like $info = pathinfo($filepath); $filename = $info['basename']; $destination = \"fedora://csv_migration/\" . $filename; We will mimic this exactly in the process section of our migration config. Just like we declare variables and call functions with PHP code, we can make entries in the process section to store the output of Drupal process plugins. We'll build up a destination \"variable\" using a filename \"variable\" and pass it into the file_copy process plugin. To start, we'll get the filename using two process plugins, which do the same steps as the first two lines of the PHP above: filename: - plugin: callback callable: pathinfo source: file - plugin: extract index: - basename The first process plugin, callback , lets you execute any PHP function that takes a single input and returns an output. It's not as flexible as making your own custom process plugin, but it's still pretty useful in a lot of situations. Here we're using it to call pathinfo() , telling it to use the file column in the CSV as input. We pass the resulting array from pathinfo() to the extract process plugin, which pulls data out of arrays using the keys you provide it under index . Now that we have the file name, we have to prepend it with fedora://csv_migration/ to make the destination URI. In our PHP code above, we used . to concatenate the strings. In the migration framework, we use the concat process plugin. You provide it with two or more strings to concatenate, as well as a delimiter. destination: plugin: concat delimiter: / source: - constants/destination_dir - '@filename' In our PHP code, we concatenated the $filename variable with a string literal. In our process plugin, we can provide the variable, e.g. the output of the filename process step, by prefixing it with an @ . We can't, however, pass in fedora://csv_migration directly as a string. At first glance, you might think something like this would work, but it totally doesn't: # Can't do this. Won't work at all. destination: plugin: concat delimiter: / source: - 'fedora://csv_migration' - '@filename' That's because the migrate framework only interprets source values as names of columns from the CSV or names of other process steps. Even if they're wrapped in quotes. It will never try to use the string directly as a value. To circumvent this, we declare a constant in the source section of the migration config. constants: destination_dir: 'fedora://csv_migration' This constant can be referenced as constants/destination_dir and passed into the concat process plugin as a source . There are a lot more process plugins available through the (core) Migrate and Migrate Plus modules, and they are documented on Drupal.org .","title":"The Process Section in Depth"},{"location":"technical-documentation/migrate-csv/#running-the-file-migration","text":"Migrations can be executed via drush using the migrate:import command. You specify which migration to run by using the id defined in its YAML. You also need to set parameters to tell Drush who you are and what your site's URL is. Failing to do so will result in derivatives not being generated and malformed/improper RDF. So don't forget them! To run the file migration from the command line, make sure you're within /var/www/html/drupal/web (or any subdirectory) and enter drush -y --userid=1 --uri=localhost:8000 migrate:import file If you've already run the migration before, but want to re-run it for any reason, use the --update flag. drush -y --userid=1 --uri=localhost:8000 migrate:import file --update You may have noticed that migrations can be grouped, and that they define a migration_group in their configuration. You can execute an entire group of migrations using the --group flag. For example, to run the entire group defined in this module drush -y --userid=1 --uri=localhost:8000 migrate:import --group migrate_islandora_csv You can also use the migrate:rollback command to delete all migrated entities. Like migrate:import , it also respects the --group flag and --uri parameter. So to rollback everything we just did: drush -y --uri=localhost:8000 migrate:rollback --group migrate_islandora_csv If something goes bad during development, sometimes migrations can get stuck in a bad state. Use the migrate:reset command to put a migration back to Idle .

If values contained special characters such as colons, quotes would be needed. If you look at the process section, you can see we're taking the title , description , and issued columns from the CSV and applying them directly to the migrated nodes without any manipulation. title: title field_description: description field_edtf_date: issued For subtitle , we're passing it through the skip_on_empty process plugin because not every row in our CSV has a subtitle entry. It's very useful when you have spotty data, and you'll end up using it a lot. The method: process bit tells the migrate framework only skip that particular field if the value is empty, and not to skip the whole row. It's important, so don't forget it. The full YAML for setting field_alternative_title from subtitle looks like this: field_alternative_title: plugin: skip_on_empty source: subtitle method: process Now here's where things get interesting. We can look up other entities to populate entity reference fields. For example, all Repository Items have an entity reference field that holds a taxonomy term from the islandora_models vocabulary. All of our examples are images, so we'll look up the Image model in the vocabulary since it already exists (it gets made for you when you use islandora-playbook). We use the entity_lookup process plugin to do this. field_model: plugin: entity_lookup source: constants/model entity_type: taxonomy_term # 'name' is the string value of the term, e.g. 'Original file', 'Thumbnail'. value_key: name bundle_key: vid bundle: islandora_models The entity_lookup process plugin looks up an entity based on the configuration you give it. You use the entity_type , bundle_key , and bundle configurations to limit which entities you search through. entity_type is, as you'd suspect, the type of entity: node, media, file, taxonomy_term, etc... bundle_key tells the migrate framework which property holds the bundle of the entity, and bundle is the actual bundle id you want to restrict by. In this case we specify the vid (vocabulary id) has to be islandora_models - which is the machine name of the vocabulary we're interested in. In this plugin, source is the value to search for - in this case we're looking for the string \"Image\", which we've defined as a constant. And we're comparing it to the name field on each term by setting the value_key config. This approach applies the same taxonomy term to all objects. If you want to assign a taxonomy term at the node level (that is, potentially a different term for each node) rather than to all the nodes being imported, you can use a configuration as illustrated next. In this example, we have a column in our CSV input file with the header 'model', which we define as the source of the field_model values: field_model: plugin: entity_lookup # 'model' is the header of a field in our input CSV that contains the string value of the taxonomy term. source: model entity_type: taxonomy_term value_key: name bundle_key: vid bundle: islandora_models If you're not sure that the entities you're looking up already exist, you can use the entity_generate plugin, which takes the same config, but will create a new entity if the lookup fails. We use this plugin to create subject taxonomy terms that we tag our nodes with. A node can have multiple subjects, so we've encoded them in the CSV as pipe delimited strings. subject Neon signs|Night Neon signs|Night|Funny Neon signs|Night Drinking|Neon signs Neon signs We can hack those apart easily enough. In PHP we'd do something like $subjects = explode($string, '|'); $terms = []; foreach ($subjects as $name) { $terms[] = \\Drupal::service('entity_type.manager')->getStorage('taxonomy_term')->create([ ... 'vid' => 'subject', 'name' => $name, ... ]); } $node->set('field_subject', $terms); With process plugins, that logic looks like field_subject: - plugin: skip_on_empty source: subject method: process - plugin: explode delimiter: '|' - plugin: entity_generate entity_type: taxonomy_term value_key: name bundle_key: vid bundle: subject Here we've got a small pipeline that uses the skip_on_empty process plugin, which we've already seen, followed by explode . The explode process plugin operates exactly like its PHP counterpart, taking an array and a delimiter as input. The combination of skip_on_empty and explode behave like a foreach loop on the explode results. If we have an empty string, nothing happens. If there's one or more pipe delimited subject names in the string, then entity_generate gets called for each name that's found. The entity_generate process plugin will try to look up a subject by name, and if that fails, it creates one using the name and saves a reference to it in the node. So entity_generate is actually smarter than our pseudo-code above, because it can be run over and over again and it won't duplicate entities. :champagne:","title":"Ingesting Nodes"},{"location":"technical-documentation/migrate-csv/#complex-fields","text":"Some fields don't hold just a single type of value. In other words, not everything is just text, numbers, or references. Using Drupal 8's Typed Data API , fields can hold groups of named values with different types. Consider a field that holds an RGB color. You could set it with PHP like so: $node->set('field_color', ['R' => 255, 'G' => 255, 'B' => 255]); You could even have a multi-valued color field, and do something like this $node->set('field_color', [ ['R' => 0, 'G' => 0, 'B' => 0], ['R' => 255, 'G' => 255, 'B' => 255], ]); In the migrate framework, you have two options for handling these types of fields. You can build up the full array they're expecting, which is difficult and requires a custom process plugin. Or, if you only have one value going into a complex field, you can set each named component in the field with separate process pipelines. In controlled_access_terms , we define a new field type of typed_relation , which is an entity reference coupled with a MARC relator. It expects an associative array that looks like this: [ 'target_id' => 1, 'rel_type' => 'relators:ctb'] The target_id portion takes an entity id, and rel_type takes the predicate for the MARC relator we want to use to describe the relationship the entity has with the repository item. This example would reference taxonomy_term 1 and give it the relator for \"Contributor\". If we have a single name to deal with, we can set those values in YAML, accessing field_linked_agent/target_id and field_linked_agent/rel_type independently. field_linked_agent/target_id: plugin: entity_generate source: photographer entity_type: taxonomy_term value_key: name bundle_key: vid bundle: person field_linked_agent/rel_type: constants/relator Here we're looking at the photographer column in the CSV, which contains the names of the photographers that captured these images. Since we know these are photographers, and not publishers or editors, we can bake in the relator constant we set to relators:pht in the source section of the migration. So all that's left to do is to set the taxonomy term's id via entity_generate . If the lookup succeeds, the id is returned. If it fails, a term is created and its id is returned. In the end, by using the / syntax to set properties on complex fields, everything gets wrapped up into that nice associative array structure for you automatically. However, if you have multiple names, and/or multiple columns that contain values that will go into the same typed_relation field, you do need to build up a full array of structured data. We start by extracting the values in the photographer column, and busting them into a list. (In this case, given the sample data, the lists will all have length 1). Then, we use a custom process plugin to make each value the value in an associative array (see example data below). photographers: - source: photographer plugin: skip_on_empty method: process - plugin: explode delimiter: '|' - plugin: str_to_assoc key: 'name' So, if we started with a column containing 'Alice|Bob|Charlie' at the end of this pipeline, the photographers temporary variable would contain [ ['name' => 'Alice'], ['name' => 'Bob'], ['name' => 'Charlie] ] Next, we use the sub_process plugin. It takes an array of associative arrays (as seen above) and iterates over them. From within subprocess' process parameter, you can access only what's defined in that associative array. Here, when we do our entity_generate lookup, our source is name , the (only) key in that array. linked_agent_pht: plugin: sub_process source: '@photographers' process: target_id: plugin: entity_generate source: name entity_type: taxonomy_term value_key: name bundle_key: vid bundle: person rel_type: plugin: default_value default_value: 'relators:pht' Within sub_process , we cannot access the temporary variables or constants that we've created in the outer migration. This is why we use the default_value plugin when for the rel_type . It would have been simpler to define a constant as we did with 'Image', but we wouldn't be able to access it. The output of this pipeline is now formatted as the structured data expected by a typed_relation field: [ ['target_id' => 42, 'rel_type' => 'relators:pht' ], ['target_id' => 43, 'rel_type' => 'relators:pht' ], ['target_id' => 44, 'rel_type' => 'relators:pht' ], ] The final step will be to assign this array to the Linked Agent field. But first, we repeat the process for another column, which contains names that have a different relator, and a different bundle. Finally, we merge the two temporary variables and pass the result to field_linked_agent . We don't have to assign the sub-components of field_linked_agent here, because this is already the structured data it is looking for. field_linked_agent: plugin: merge source: - '@linked_agent_pht' - '@linked_agent_prv' Clear as mud? Great. Now let's run that migration.","title":"Complex Fields"},{"location":"technical-documentation/migrate-csv/#running-the-node-migration","text":"Like with the file migration, run drush -y --userid=1 --uri=http://localhost:8000 migrate:import node from anywhere within the Drupal installation directory will fire off the migration. Go to http://localhost:8000/admin/content and you should see five new nodes. Click on one, though, and you'll see it's just a stub with metadata. The CSV metadata is there, links to other entities like subjects and photographers are there, but there's no trace of the corresponding files. Here's where media entities come into play.","title":"Running the node migration"},{"location":"technical-documentation/migrate-csv/#migrating-media","text":"Media entities are Drupal's solution for fieldable files. Since you can't put fields on a file, what you can do is wrap the file with a Media entity. In addition to a reference to the file (binary), technical metadata and structural metadata for the file go on the Media entity (e.g. MIME type, file size, resolution). Media also have a few special fields that are required for Islandora, field_media_of and field_use , which denote what node owns the media and what role the media serves, respectively. Since the Media entity references both the file it wraps and the node that owns it, Media entities act as a bridge between files and nodes, tying them together. And to do this, we make use of one last process plugin, migration_lookup . Open up /var/www/html/drupal/web/modules/contrib/migrate_islandora_csv/config/install/migrate_plus.migration.media.yml and give it a look. # Uninstall this config when the feature is uninstalled dependencies: enforced: module: - migrate_islandora_csv id: media label: Import Media from CSV migration_group: migrate_islandora_csv source: plugin: csv path: modules/contrib/migrate_islandora_csv/data/migration.csv # 1 means you have a header row, 0 means you don't header_row_count: 1 # Each migration needs a unique key per row in the csv.

There's no string or array manipulation in YAML, and at most there's only one process plugin per field. Title and user are set directly, with no processing required name: title uid: constants/uid The field_media_use field is a tag that's used to denote the purpose of a file with regard to the node it belongs to. E.g. is this the original file? a lower quality derivative? thumbnail? etc... In many ways it bears a resemblance to DSID in Islandora 7.x. Like field_model with nodes, the vocabulary already exists in your Islandora install, so all you have to do is look it up with the entity_lookup plugin. # Make the media an 'Original File' field_media_use: plugin: entity_lookup source: constants/use entity_type: taxonomy_term value_key: name bundle_key: vid bundle: islandora_media_use The field_media_image and field_media_of fields are how the media binds a file to a node. You could use entity_lookup or entity_generate , but we've already migrated them and can very easily look them up by the id assigned to them during migration. But what's the benefit of doing so? The entity_lookup and entity_generate process plugins do the job fine, right? The main advantage of using migration_lookup and defining migrations whenever possible, is that migrated entities can be rolled back. If you were to hop into your console and execute drush -y --uri=http://localhost:8000 migrate:rollback --group migrate_islandora_csv Your nodes, media, and files would all be gone. But your subjects and photographers would remain. If you want to truly and cleanly roll back every entity in a migration, you need to define those migrations and use migration_lookup to set entity reference fields.","title":"Migrating Media"},{"location":"technical-documentation/migrate-csv/#running-the-media-migration","text":"Run drush -y --uri=http://localhost:8000 migrate:import media from anywhere within the Drupal installation directory.

You've seen how to transform data with pipelines of processing plugins and can handle numeric, text, and entity reference fields. You can handle multiple values for fields, and even more complicated things like typed_relation fields. And as big as this walkthrough was, we're only scratching the surface of what can be done with the Migrate API.","title":"What have we learned?"},{"location":"technical-documentation/migrate-csv/#where-to-go-from-here","text":"There's certainly more you can do with Drupal 8's Migrate API. There's a plethora of source and processing plugins out there that can handle pretty much anything you throw at it. XML and JSON are fair game. You can also request sources using HTTP, so you can always point it at an existing systems REST API and go from there. If you can't make the Migrate API's existing workflow make the necessary changes to your data, you can expand its capabilities by writing your own process plugins. Reading the Drupal.org documentation on the Migrate API would be a good place to start. But really the best thing to do is try and get your data into Islandora! We intend to create a boilerplate branch of this repository that will allow you to clone down a migration template, ready for you to customize to fit your data. And as you assemble it into CSV format, keep in mind that if you have more than just names for things like subjects and authors, that you can always make more CSVs. Think of it like maintaining tables in an SQL database. Each CSV has unique keys, so you can lookup/join entities between CSVs using those keys. And you can still pipe-delimit the keys like we did in our example to handle multi-valued fields. In some repositories, these CSVs can be used to make bulk updates to metadata. Just make your changes to maintain the CSVs, then run the migration(s) again with the --update flag. This will not always be efficient, as you'll update every entity, even if it didn't change. But, by breaking down your CSVs per collection or object type, you could keep them small enough to use this process for a small repository. There is also a tool for migrating directly from an Islandora 7.x to Islandora 8 ( migrate_7x_claw ), using Solr, XPaths, and Fedora calls to pull files and objects directly into Islandora 8. It may be worth checking out, and/or using in conjunction with a CSV migration.","title":"Where to go from here?"},{"location":"technical-documentation/ppa-documentation/","text":"Updating a deb and adding it to LYRASIS PPA Background Ubuntu removed JPEG2000 support from ImageMagick since Vivid Vervet's 8:6.8.9.9-5 version.

These are defined under Authorization on the overview. Content (Nodes) The above setup shows that you can perform a POST request against a node at the /node endpoint with a body in the JSON format. To create a node you need to provide two elements in your message body. The node type and any required field values.

A model - this is a required by Islandora to tell the type of object (i.e. Image, Audio, Collection) A good way to make your first POST request is to perform a GET request against an existing node and erase all the extra content.

The node can be referenced using the value of the target_id key (in this example, 1) or the target_uuid key (8322e36e-f8ec-4fd9-919d-52aed7b17a52). Files Through the REST API you are accessing metadata about files, but not the actual binary object. Based on the above configuration the path for a GET request is /entity/file/{id} The file ID refers to the integer counter and not the UUID of a file. Through the UI you can go to the File listing at http://localhost:8000/admin/content/files . For the file you want to access, choose the USED IN link. That URI has the format http://localhost:8000/admin/content/files/usage/{file id} Alternatively the file ID can be found by viewing the media metadata (above section). In the above example if you look through the response from a GET request to the /media/{id} you will find a section like: \"field_media_image\": [ { \"target_id\": 3, \"alt\": null, \"title\": null, \"width\": 800, \"height\": 1333, \"target_type\": \"file\", \"target_uuid\": \"e97ad038-dcb3-4d81-aa91-c945b2fe092c\", \"url\": \"http:\\\\/\\\\/localhost:8000\\\\/sites\\\\/default\\\\/files\\\\/2019-03\\\\/1-Service%20File.jpg\" } ], Note : Depending on the \"type\" of file (image, video, audio, file) this field will have a different name. This has both the url which is the URI to retrieve the binary content of the file as well as the target_id which is the file ID. So we can retrieve the file with a GET request to the URI http://localhost:8000/sites/default/files/2019-03/1-Service%20File.jpg . But more importantly we can retrieve the file metadata by making a request to http://localhost:8000/entity/file/3 with one of the allowed formats \ud83c\udf4e For example: > curl -i -X GET \"http://localhost:8000/entity/file/3?_format=json\" HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Tue, 05 Mar 2019 16:52:06 GMT Server: Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu) X-Powered-By: PHP/7.1.26-1+ubuntu16.04.1+deb.sury.org+1 Cache-Control: must-revalidate, no-cache, private X-Drupal-Dynamic-Cache: MISS X-UA-Compatible: IE=edge Content-language: en X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN Expires: Sun, 19 Nov 1978 05:00:00 GMT Vary: X-Generator: Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org) X-Drupal-Cache: HIT Content-Length: 634 Content-Type: application/json { \"fid\": [ { \"value\": 3 } ], \"uuid\": [ { \"value\": \"e97ad038-dcb3-4d81-aa91-c945b2fe092c\" } ], \"langcode\": [ { \"value\": \"en\" } ], \"uid\": [ { \"target_id\": 1, \"target_type\": \"user\", \"target_uuid\": \"46a47057-de2d-4ce2-87ae-dbe4551209b8\", \"url\": \"\\\\/user\\\\/1\" } ], \"filename\": [ { \"value\": \"1-Service File.jpg\" } ], \"uri\": [ { \"value\": \"public:\\\\/\\\\/2019-03\\\\/1-Service File.jpg\", \"url\": \"\\\\/sites\\\\/default\\\\/files\\\\/2019-03\\\\/1-Service%20File.jpg\" } ], \"filemime\": [ { \"value\": \"image\\\\/jpeg\" } ], \"filesize\": [ { \"value\": 166608 } ], \"status\": [ { \"value\": true } ], \"created\": [ { \"value\": \"2019-03-01T19:43:48+00:00\", \"format\": \"Y-m-d\\\\TH:i:sP\" } ], \"changed\": [ { \"value\": \"2019-03-01T19:43:48+00:00\", \"format\": \"Y-m-d\\\\TH:i:sP\" } ] } The uri: url: is the path to your file, so for the above example of \"url\": \"\\\\/sites\\\\/default\\\\/files\\\\/2019-03\\\\/1-Service%20File.jpg\" .

Based on the above configuration the path for a GET request is /entity/file/{id} The file ID refers to the integer counter and not the UUID of a file. Through the UI you can go to the File listing at http://localhost:8000/admin/content/files . For the file you want to access, choose the USED IN link. That URI has the format http://localhost:8000/admin/content/files/usage/{file id} Alternatively the file ID can be found by viewing the media metadata (above section). In the above example if you look through the response from a GET request to the /media/{id} you will find a section like: \"field_media_image\": [ { \"target_id\": 3, \"alt\": null, \"title\": null, \"width\": 800, \"height\": 1333, \"target_type\": \"file\", \"target_uuid\": \"e97ad038-dcb3-4d81-aa91-c945b2fe092c\", \"url\": \"http:\\\\/\\\\/localhost:8000\\\\/sites\\\\/default\\\\/files\\\\/2019-03\\\\/1-Service%20File.jpg\" } ], Note : Depending on the \"type\" of file (image, video, audio, file) this field will have a different name. This has both the url which is the URI to retrieve the binary content of the file as well as the target_id which is the file ID. So we can retrieve the file with a GET request to the URI http://localhost:8000/sites/default/files/2019-03/1-Service%20File.jpg .

These Link headers follow a standard format as specified in RFC8288 . Drupal already makes use of this technique for content entities, and Islandora takes it even further by providing additional Link headers that enable the client to navigate the repository and discover additional information about various resources. Because the links are returned in response headers, they can be relied upon without having to parse the message body. This makes them consistent across all serialization formats that can be returned in a message body (XML, JSON, JSONLD, etc...). As a general precaution, link headers for Drupal entities are not exposed to users that do not have the permissions to view the entity linked in the header. So making GET and HEAD requests anonymously will yield a different set of headers than what an authenticated user would see. For example, anonymous users don't have the view media permission, so they will not see the link headers for media associated with a node. Link Headers Provided by Islandora Alternate Representations Other representations generated by different serializers available through Drupal's REST API are exposed as link headers with rel=\"alternate\" and type equal to the mimetype that will be received when dereferencing the link. For example, if an entity in Drupal has a JSONLD representation, then the link header returned in a GET or HEAD response would look like Link: <http://example.org/node/1?_format=jsonld>; rel=\"alternate\"; type=\"application/ld+json\" Referenced Entities Entity reference fields are exposed as link headers with rel=\"related\" and a title equal to the entity reference field's display label. For example, if http://example.org/node/1 has an entity reference field name \"Associated Content\" that references http://example.org/node/2 , then the link header returned in a GET or HEAD response would look like Link: <http://example.org/node/2>; rel=\"related\"; title=\"Associated Content\" Referenced Taxonomy Terms Entity reference fields for taxonomy terms get special handling. The taxonomy terms used to tag content are exposed as link headers with rel=\"tag\" and a title equal to the taxonomy term's display label. If the term has an external URI in a controlled vocabulary, then that URI is provided. Otherwise, the local Drupal URI is provided. For example, if a piece of content is tagged with taxonomy/term/1 , which has a display label of \"Example Term\", then the link header returned in a GET or HEAD response would look like Link: <http://example.org/taxonomy/term/1>; rel=\"tag\"; title=\"Example Term\" If instead the term were to have the field_external_uri field with a value of http://exampletwo.org/vocab#term then the link header would look like Link: <http://exampletwo.org/vocab#term>; rel=\"tag\"; title=\"Example Term\" . Associated Media Media entities belonging to nodes are exposed as link headers with rel=\"related\" and a title equal to the display label of their field_media_use taxonomy term. For example, if a media is tagged as Original File indicating that it is the initial file uploaded, the link header returned in a GET or HEAD response for a node would look like Link: <http://example.org/media/1>; rel=\"related\"; title=\"Original File\" . Source Files Files that are the source for media entities are exposed as Link headers in the GET and HEAD responses with rel=\"describes\" . The endpoint to edit the contents of the source file is also exposed using rel=\"edit-media\" . For example, if http://example.org/media/1 has the source file http://example.org/file.txt , then a GET or HEAD response would contain both Link: <http://example.org/file.txt>; rel=\"describes\" Link: <http://example.org/media/1/source>; rel=\"edit-media\" Examples Requesting a Node After creating a node, adding it to a Collection, uploading a file and kicking off derivatives, the link headers returned for said node would look like the following.

Let's unpack it: You need to run this as the apache user for filesystem access, hence sudo -u www-data Despite having a .sh extension, you run the command with php: php core/scripts/run-tests.sh --suppress-deprecations tells the script not to count deprecation warnings as test failures --url http://127.0.0.1:8000 tells the script what base url to use for functional tests. If you are using a port other than 8000, you'll need to make sure to update this accordingly --verbose is optional, but useful if you want more feedback from failures --php `which php` tells the script where to find the php executable to use --module \"islandora\" tells the script to run all tests from the islandora module If you want to run just a single class instead of a whole module's worth, you can use the --class option instead of --module .

The map between Drupal URIs and their corresponding Fedora URIs is stored in a service called Gemini. An Islandora \"pseudo-field\" can be enabled that will display the corresponding Fedora URI on the page of a node, taxonomy term, or media object. You can also query Gemini directly. Instructions for doing that are provided below. For more information about the Gemini service, see the Gemini README . Fedora URI Pseudo-field To display the Fedora URI pseudo-field on a Drupal node, media, or taxonomy term, go to Manage > Configuration > Islandora and select all the bundles for which you would like the Fedora URI displayed. A valid Gemini URL is required. On the playbook , Gemini is at http://localhost:8080/gemini. Once you have selected the bundles, and cleared the cache, the new pseudo-field will appear at the bottom of all display modes. You can alter where in the display the Fedora URI field appears, by going to the \"Manage Display\" page for the bundle. For example, for a Repository Item, you'd go to http://localhost:8000/admin/structure/types/manage/islandora_object/display. In that list you should see Fedora URI which you can move around (or hide) as desired. Clearing cache may be necessary to refresh the node display. How to look up a Fedora URI through Gemini (nodes and taxonomy terms) In Gemini, each entry is keyed on the UUID assigned by Drupal (the long one, not the node id). To get the UUID of a node, or taxonomy term in Drupal, you can look in the Devel tab or in the JSON representation, e.g.: http://localhost:8000/node/2?_format=json . Then, query the Gemini REST service (using a REST client such as POSTman, or a command-line tool such as curl ) for that UUID: curl -H \"Authorization:Bearer islandora\" http://localhost:8000/gemini/[uuid_value] Alternatively, you can login to SQL, choose the gemini database, and issue a query. With the playbook's default setup: vagrant ssh mysql -uroot -pislandora gemini select fedora_uri from Gemini where drupal_uri = 'http://localhost:8000/node/[nid]?_format=jsonld'; How to look up a Fedora URI through Gemini (files)? Files in Fedora have the file URI in Gemini, and can be queried based on the UUID (accessible from the Media's json) or their URI. select fedora_uri from Gemini where drupal_uri = 'http://localhost:8000/_flysystem/fedora/2019-05/639647.jpg'; Media and Gemini Media objects aren't indexed in Gemini.

What is Composer It is recommended by Drupal.org and the Islandora 8 community to use Composer with Drupal 8 for various tasks. \" Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. Drupal core uses Composer to manage core dependencies like Symfony components and Guzzle.\" [ Source ] Always create backs ups (DB and files) before updating Before updating either Drupal core or Drupal modules: * Back up both your files and database. Having a complete backup makes it easy to revert to the prior version if the update fails. * Optionally, if you made manual modifications to files like .htaccess, composer.json, or robots.txt, copy them somewhere easy to find. Because after you've installed the new Drupal core, you will need to re-apply the changes. For example, Acquia Dev Desktop places a .htaccess file in the top-level directory and without it, only the homepage on your site will work. Warning: Always revert to a backup if you get a fatal error in the update process. Updating Drupal Core Over time new versions of Drupal \u201ccore\u201d are released, and Islandora users are encouraged to install official Drupal core updates and security patches. On the other hand \u201calpha\u201d and \u201cbeta\" versions of Drupal core should only be installed by advanced users for testing purposes. The Islandora community STRONGLY recommends that the \"Composer\" method of upgrading Drupal core be used with Islandora 8 as mentioned here . Here is an overview of the steps for updating Drupal core using Composer !!! \"Back Up\" First make sure you have made database and file back ups. 1) First, verify that an update of Drupal core actually is available: composer outdated \"drupal/*\" If there is no line starting with drupal/core, Composer isn't aware of any update. If there is an update, continue with the commands below. 2) Assuming you are used to updating Drupal and know all the precautions that you should take, the update is as simple as: composer update drupal/core webflo/drupal-core-require-dev \"symfony/*\" --with-dependencies If you want to know all packages that will be updated by the update command, use the --dry-run option first. !!! note \"Alternate syntax needed\": Islandora 8 is configured to use a fork of drupal-composer/drupal-project which requires a specific composer syntax used above compared to other Drupal 8 sites. In addition, if you are upgrading from 8.5 to 8.7, you need to replace \"~8.5.x\" with \"^8.7.0\" for drupal/core and webflo/drupal-core-require-dev in composer.json.

There are two approaches to updating Drupal modules in Islandora: using Composer or updating modules individually. Islandora 8 uses Composer to determine which Drupal module versions should be installed for each release of Islandora 8. Therefore if you update the Islandora specific Drupal modules using Composer you will also update any dependent general Drupal modules as well.

Authorization Getting resources - GET Creating resources - POST/PUT Updating resources - PATCH Deleting resources - DELETE Authorization If your resources are restricted (hidden) you will need to have authorization to access them. You can specify which types of authentication are allowed for which HTTP methods. These are common to all HTTP methods against the REST API. In the above screenshot we have 3 allowed methods. 1. basic_auth 1. jwt_auth 1. cookie Basic authentication (basic_auth) To use basic authentication with a client like cURL use the -u username:password argument. For example: curl -u admin:islandora http://localhost:8000/node/3 JWT authentication (jwt_auth) By default JWTs are passed internally from Drupal to various microservices and Fedora. To use a JWT yourself you need to enable the JWT Authentication Issuer module. Once enabled this module makes a /jwt/token endpoint.

Some examples of blocks are your site's menu, breadcrumbs, search block, etc... You have a lot of control over when and where you see blocks using Drupal's administrative interface. You can create and delete blocks, as well as move them around in different locations on the page (called 'regions' in Drupal theme terminology). You can also control on which pages the blocks are visible, allowing you to conditionally show/hide them as appropriate. Blocks are made available to place by enabling the Drupal modules that provide them, and there's lots out there to choose from. Placing blocks is an essential skill for any site administrator, so let's jump right in and get our hands dirty. Using the admin toolbar, navigate to Admin > Structure > Block layout (admin/structure/block). You will see a table listing all of the available regions provided by the current theme for block placement. You can switch between available themes using the tabs above the table. For each region, enabled blocks are listed and can be re-arranged. Take a look at the \"Main Content\" region for example. If you wanted to move the content above its tabs, you could drag the \"Main page content\" block above the \"Tabs\" block. If you scroll all the way down to the bottom and click the \"Save blocks\" button, now when you go to view content you should see something like this If you want to add a new block to a region, hit the \"Place block\" button for that region and you'll be brought to a modal that will let you select which block to place. After selecting your block, you will be brought to its configuration form. Here you can give the block a different title, change its region using a dropdown, and control its visibility settings by configuring various conditions. In our case, we're adding the \"Development\" block to the \"Footer\" region. And since we want to see this block everywhere, we'll leave the visibility settings alone for now. Click the \"Save block\" button, and now if we go view some content we should see the \"Development\" menu in the footer of our site. If we want to limit this eyesore to only the front page of our site, we can revisit the visibility settings of the block. Navigate to the block we just placed on the block placement page, and click its \"Configure\" button. Here you can limit the block to show only for certain roles or content types. You can also explicitly set a white or black list of pages, which is what we'll do. Click the Pages tab and you'll have a text area you can list pages in. We're going to enter <front> , which is a special value that means \"The front page of your site\". Underneath the text area, you can select whether you are showing or hiding the block for this list of pages. We want to show this only on the front page, so we'll leave it set at \"Show for the listed pages\". Click \"Save block\" and go back to a piece of content. You shouldn't see the development menu. But go to the frontpage and... Using Context The visibility conditions in the block placement user interface are simple and effective. They cover the majority of use cases, however, there are times when you need even more control. This is where the Context module really shines. Any condition available to the Context module can be used to control block visibility. And you can even combine conditions using Boolean (AND/OR) logic. For example, in the islandora_defaults feature, we provide a context specifically for showing a list of members of a collection. All of our content is the same content type (Repository Item), and Collections are distinguished by being tagged with the \"Collection\" taxonomy term. Using the admin toolbar, if you navigate to Admin > Structure > Context (admin/structure/context), you should see a list of all contexts available to the site. Click the \"Configure\" button on the \"Collection\" context. You can see in its \"Condition\" section, we have the \"Node has term\" condition, which checks for content tagged with the term provided by the user. In this case, it's set to look for the \"Collection\" tag. Underneath, in the \"Reaction\" section, you can see that the \"Block\" reaction has been selected, and its configuration looks a lot like the core block placement UI. The only difference here is that when the \"Include blocks from block layout\" box is checked, you are only placing the blocks you want to add in addition to an already existing block layout. If you uncheck the box, you are creating an entirely new block layout from scratch, and will have to replace basic things like breadcrumbs and menus. Here you can see we've added only the members block to this block layout. If we go and navigate to a collection, you'll see its list of members underneath its content. If we edit the collection and change its model tag from \"Collection\" to anything else, you'll see the block disappears! As you can see, block placement can be very flexible, and allow you to customize your site in a very granular fashion. Between using core block placement and the context module, there's no block you can't get into the right place on your site.

Repository content is aggregated in a collection by setting the field_member_of entity reference field to point to a collection. Generally speaking, anything can behave as a collection, and anything with field_member_of can be a member of a collection. However, Islandora provides a \"Collection\" taxonomy term in the Islandora Models vocabulary that can be used to trigger collection-specific behavior. For example, a context provided by Islandora Defaults will display a list of child resource node teasers on the resources' display page when this term is applied to the field_model field. Collections and Deleting Collections and their members are independent of each other, and removing something from a collection does not delete it. Similarly, deleting a collection does not delete its members. Creating a Collection When logged in as an administrator, click the Content button under the Manage tab. Click on Add content .

Graphical User Interface This page will address how to create and modify ingest forms (or rather, content types) via the GUI. For help working with forms via the API, please check out the Further Reading section for links to more advanced Drupal documentation. Since objects in Islandora 8 are stored in Drupal as Nodes, we use the standard Drupal Content Types system to create and edit our \u2018ingest forms\u2019 Content Types in Drupal 8 . Islandora 8 forms are Drupal forms, and if you are already familiar with Drupal Field UI, you\u2019re already well equipped to create and modify your own ingest forms in Islandora 8. This page will address how to create and modify ingest forms (or rather, content types) via the GUI. For help working with forms via the API, please check out the Further Reading section for links to more advanced Drupal documentation. Modify a Content Type If you have deployed your Islandora 8 with the Islandora Demo configuration, you will already have a Repository Item content type available, with pre-configured fields. In the Admin menu, go to Structure >> Content Types and find the Repository Item content type. Select Manage Fields . You will see a list of the fields that are already available in the Repository Item content type. Add a Field Let\u2019s add a new field where a user can indicate if the repository item needs to be reviewed: Click \u201cAdd Field\u201d In some cases an existing field may be available to use instead of creating a new one. The dropdown box labeled 'Re-use an existing field' has a list of available fields. For our example we will create a brand-new field. Since our example field is a \u201cyes/no\u201d decision (whether the item needs review or not), choose \"Boolean\" from the dropdown menu and give the Label field a name. See the list of Drupal 8 FieldTypes, FieldWidgets, and FieldFormatters for descriptions of the different types available by default. Additional modules, such as the controlled_access_terms module, can provide their own Field types to choose from as well. Click \"Save and continue.\" Next, configure how the field is stored in the Drupal database. For this field type you can select how many values will be allowed. The default settings, \"Limited\" in the dropdown box and \"1\" for the allowed number of values works for our example. Click \"Save field settings.\" Then configure how the field is described (including its display label and the help text for when it appears on a form) and constraints on its use. In this case, the field will be required for this Content Type, and will be set to \u201con\u201d by default. In the \"Default Value\" section, click the checkbox next to \"Needs Review\" to indicate all new repository items need review by default. Click \"Save settings.\" The new field has been added: And it appears in the ingest form when we try to create a new repository object. To test this, go to Content >> Add content >> Repository item: RDF Mappings New fields, with the exception of Typed Relation fields, are not automatically indexed in Fedora and the triple-store. Update the Content Type's RDF Mapping to enable indexing the field (see below). Search New fields will not automatically be searchable. They need to be added to the SOLR index configuration. See the 'Setup and Configure Search' page for more information. Context To add new behavior based on the results of this new field, check out Context . Change the Form Display Now let\u2019s move our new field to a different part of the form. In the Admin menu, return to Structure > Content Types and find the Repository Item content type again. Select Manage form display. All of the fields in this content type are available, in a list, with a simple drag-and-place UI. Drag the new field to the top of the form. We can also change the way the Boolean options are displayed, with radio buttons as opposed to a single checkbox. Different display options will be available from the dropdown menu depending on field type. For more information, please check out List of Drupal 8 FieldTypes, FieldWidgets, and FieldFormatters Save. When creating a new Repository Item, the new field appears at the top, as a set of radio buttons. Change the Content Display Finally, let\u2019s change how the results of this field are displayed. Initially the new field shows up at the bottom of repository object pages: In the Admin menu, return to Structure > Content Types and find the Repository Item content type again. Select Manage display from the dropdown menu. Find the new field. You can change how the field title or Label is displayed. Click the dropdown menu to choose from inline/above/hidden/visually hidden. You can also replace the options displayed with variations on a binary choice. Click the gear to choose from the following: On/Off, Yes/No, Enabled/Disabled, 1/0. checkmark/X, or hide the field completely. You can also drag the field into the Disabled section so that neither its label or its contents appear in the display, although the field is saved on the node. Drag the field to \"Disabled\" and save. You no longer see the field on the display, but it is available when editing the node. Create a Content Type To create your own custom content type from scratch, please refer to this guide on Drupal.org. Custom content types are not synced to Fedora or indexed by the triple-store by default. Repository managers must add them to the \"Content\" ('repository_content') context before their nodes are synced to Fedora and indexed by the triple-store. Navigate to the Contexts configuration page ('/admin/structure/context'). Find the 'Content' context and click the corresponding 'Edit' button ('/admin/structure/context/repository_content'). Find the 'Node Bundle' condition in the 'Conditions' section. Click the checkbox for the new Content Type. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click 'Save and continue'. Updating contexts does not retroactively fire any actions. Any of the custom content type's nodes that were created before updating the context will need to have the indexing action manually triggered. Update / Create an RDF Mapping RDF mapping aligns Drupal fields with RDF ontology properties. For example, the title field of a content model can be mapped to dcterms:title and/or schema:title. In Islandora 8, triples expressed by these mappings get synced to Fedora and indexed in the Blazegraph triplestore. RDF mappings are defined/stored in Drupal as a YAML file (to learn more about YAML, there are several tutorials on the web . Currently, Drupal 8 does not have a UI to create/update RDF mappings to ontologies other than Schema.org. This requires repository managers to update the configuration files themselves. Consider using the RDF mappings included in islandora_demo as templates by copying and modifying one to meet your needs. The Drupal 8 Configuration Synchronization export (e.g. http://localhost:8000/admin/config/development/configuration/single/export ) and import (e.g. http://localhost:8000/admin/config/development/configuration/single/import ) can be used to get a copy of the mappings for editing in a text editor before being uploaded again. Alternatively, a repository manager can update the configuration on the server and use Features to import the edits. An RDF mapping configuration file has two main areas, the mapping's metadata and the mapping itself. Most of the mapping's metadata should be left alone unless you are creating a brand new mapping for a new Content Type or Taxonomy Vocabulary. A partial example from islandora_default's islandora_object (Repository Item) is included below: langcode: en status: true dependencies: config: - node.type.islandora_object enforced: module: - islandora_demo module: - node id: node.islandora_object targetEntityType: node bundle: islandora_object types: - 'pcdm:Object' fieldMappings: title: properties: - 'dc:title' field_alternative_title: properties: - 'dc:alternative' field_edtf_date: properties: - 'dc:date' datatype_callback: callable: 'Drupal\\controlled_access_terms\\EDTFConverter::dateIso8601Value' field_description: properties: - 'dc:description' The required mapping metadata fields when creating a brand-new mapping include the id , status , targetEntityType , and bundle . ( uuid and _core , not seen in the example above but may be present in exported copies, will be added by Drupal automatically.) bundle is the machine name for the Content Type or Taxonomy Vocabulary you are creating the mapping for. targetEntityType is node for Content Types or taxonomy_term for Taxonomy Vocabularies. The id configuration is a concatenation of target entity type and bundle ('node' and 'islandora_object' in the example above). The id is also used to name the configuration file: e.g. rdf.mapping.node.islandora_object.yml is rdf.mapping. plus the id ( node.islandora_object ) and then .yml . The mapping itself consists of the types ' and fieldMappings configurations. All the mappings use RDF namespaces instead of fully-qualified URIs. For example, the type for islandora_object is pcdm:Object instead of http://pcdm.org/models#Object . Unfortunately, the available namespaces are defined in module hooks (hook_rdf_namespaces) rather than in a configuration file. Repository managers wanting to add additional namespaces need to create their own module and implement hook_rdf_namespaces. See the islandora_defaults hook implementation for an example.

This type value will be applied to every node or taxonomy term using the mapped content type or vocabulary. In some cases a repository may want a node or taxonomy term's rdf:type to be configurable. For example, the Corporate Body Vocabulary (provided by the Controlled Access Terms Default Configuration module) has schema:Organization set as the default type in the RDF mapping. However, more granular types may apply to one organization and not another, such as schema:GovernmentOrganization or schema:Corporation . The alter_jsonld_type Context reaction allows Content Types and Taxonomy Vocabularies to add a field's values as rdf:types to its JSON-LD serialization (the format used to index a node or taxonomy term in Fedora and the triple-store). fieldMappings specifies the fields to be included, their RDF property mappings, and any necessary data converters (the datatype_callback ). One field can be mapped to more than one RDF property by adding them to the field's properties list. The datatype_callback is defined by the 'callable' key and the fully qualified static method used to convert it to the desired data format. For example, fields of the Drupal datetime type need to be converted to ISO 8601 values, so we use the Drupal\\rdf\\CommonDataConverter::dateIso8601Value function to perform the conversion.

Context defines \"conditions\" and \"reactions\" to enact the \"if this [condition], then that [reaction]\" logic. Some Islandora 7.x repositories use the community-contributed Islandora Context module to apply this sort of logic to Islandora objects. An example Context from Islandora 7.x is If an object's namespace is 'customnamespace', render the block containing the rights statement \"Please contact Special Collections before reusing this item\". The Context project page on drupal.org says \"You can think of each context as representing a 'section' of your site\", but that doesn't tell the whole story, since it gives the impression that Context is all about defining subsites. Context in Drupal 8 is much more powerful than in Drupal 7 due to how it interacts with the rest of Drupal (specifically, through Drupal 8's new plugin API). Because of this increased flexibility and power, and because Context provides a ready-made user interface for site administrators to combine conditions and reactions, Islandora 8 uses Context to drive the logic underlying many important aspects of Islandora, including which derivatives get generated and how objects are displayed. In Islandora 7, many of these things are managed (and often hard-coded) within solution packs and utility modules. An Example Let's look at the example of how Context can determine how an object is displayed. Drupal 8 has the idea of \"view modes\", which allow site builders to choose what happens when an object is viewed by the user (it has nothing to do with Drupal Views). In the node edit form for Islandora objects, there is a checkbox that, if checked, tells Drupal to render the image using the OpenSeadragon viewer: This functionality is accomplished via the \"Open Seadragon\" Context, which, as its configuration suggests, checks as its condition whether the node as the \"Open Seadragon\" tag and if so, reacts by using the view mode \"Open Seadragon\": Context and Actions Context in Drupal 8 uses Drupal Actions to execute the \"then that\" part of their logic. An implication of this is some configuration options relevant to the outcome of the \"then that\" reaction are configured in the Action admin interface (located at admin/config/system/actions ), not within the Context admin interface (located at admin/structure/context ). While this makes for a clunky admin experience, the advantage is that it allows the reuse of a single piece of Drupal code in multiple Contexts. One important group of functionality in Islandora 8 repositories that admins might want to control is what types of media get persisted to Fedora. Islandora 8 allows administrators to choose what types of media get persisted to Fedora and what types of media get persisted to the Drupal public file system. For example, you may want to persist your thumbnails to Fedora along with your \"Preservation Master\" and \"Original File\" files. This can be accomplished using Context. By default Islandora 8 stores thumbnails in Drupal's public file system, not in Fedora. Thumbnails are automatically generated by a Context (the \"Image Service File\" Context to be specific), but if you want to change the file system where your thumbnails are stored to the be Fedora file system, you need to change that setting in the \"Image - Generate a thumbnail from a service file\" Action, not in the Context that uses that action: This configuration should be done as part of your initial Islandora 8 setup, since there is currently no way to move thumbnails that were persisted to Drupal's public file system to Fedora, or vice versa. But, at least site admins can choose one or the other using this Action. You can create custom Actions and then use them in Contexts. For example, if you want to present a message to the user every time they upload a media tagged as \"Preservation Master File\", create an Action of type \"Display a message to the user\" and enter your message: Then, create a Context that uses this Action as its Reaction, and as its Condition, uses \"Media has term\" with a value of \"Preservation Master File\": Now, when a user creates a Media and tags it as a \"Preservation Master File\", they will be shown the message you created in your Action: Tips on Using Islandora-specific Contexts Islandora provides some Conditions and Reactions that aren't available on other Drupal sites. When using them, you may find the following tips useful: When using the \"Node has term with URI\", \"Media has term with URI\", and \"Parent node for media has term with URI\" Islandora-specific Conditions, you may want to enter multiple terms to take advantage of the AND/OR logic they provide. To do so, add a comma ( , ) after the first term in the autocomplete field and continue typing. These three Conditions limit taxonomy terms that show up in their autocomplete Term field to terms that have URIs associated with them, for example from the Islandora Media Use or Islandora Models vocabularies (although any term that has a URI will appear). If you want to configure Conditions using terms that do not have a URI, you can use the contrib Term Condition module . Be as specific as possible in configuring your Conditions. If your Conditions seem to apply too broadly or in unexpected ways, try adding a \"Content Entity Type\" Condition to limit the Context to pages that render Islandora objects or media. Increased Flexibility Most Islandora 8 repository administrators will not need to alter or configure any Contexts. But since much of Islandora 8's underlying functionality is governed by this powerful Drupal contrib module, administrators should become comfortable using it, and Actions, to customize and refine their repositories.

Now, in total there are eight items in the repository. In addition to the six collection items there is one audio item and one image item. Using your Web browser open the Islandora 8 Frontpage (localhost:8000 or your test Islandora) For this example, on the frontpage we can see that Islandora displays a 'Collection' first as this is the most recently added item. To edit the frontpage view, hover over the view ('Frontpage' view) and select 'Edit view' when displayed. Select 'Add' under the filter criteria section. We do not want to display collections, so we need to add a filter criteria that does not filter for the Islandora model type 'collection' Select 'Model' from the list and then 'Apply (all displays)'. Select 'Islandora Model' to select filters on Islandora model types and select 'Apply and continue'. Select the operator 'Is none of' and the 'Collection' model (autocomplete should work here to help you). To finish select 'Apply (all displays)'. 'Save' the view. Now the 'Frontpage' view does not display collections. Task2: Add a new view to only show collections For this example, we create a new view as a block and place the new block to only display on the frontpage. We will add the new collection list block below the existing frontpage view that list items. Using your Web browser open the Islandora 8 Frontpage (localhost:8000 or your test Islandora) Navigate to Administration > Structure > Views (~/admin/structure/views) Create a new view by selecting 'Add view' Name the view and select 'Create a block'. Give the block a title, decide how you want it to display (Grid, Table, List, Paging). To progress, select 'Save and edit'. Customise the view format and sorting as required. Add a filter criteria to only show the Islandora model type of 'Collection' and 'Save' the view. Place view on frontpage. Now that we have a view as a block, we add it to the 'Main page content' area (using 'Block layout') and only display for the frontpage. Navigate to Administration > Structure > Block (/admin/structure/block). Under 'Main content' select 'Place block' Find the new block, 'Collection List' and select 'Place block'. Restrict the block to only display on the frontpage by adding the text ' ' to the 'Page' vertical tab. Then select 'Save block'. Review the block placement and move if required. The 'Collection list' now only displays on the frontpage. It displays below the 'Main page content'.

When comparing new Islandora and Fedora to older versions it may also be helpful to reference the Islandora 7 Glossary . CLAW CLAW (CLAW Linked Asset WebDataFrameWork) was the development code name for the software released in June, 2019 as Islandora 8 . Collection Collections are a way of grouping related objects together in Islandora. They function much like directories on a computer; a collection can \u201ccontain\u201d any number of related resource nodes and sub-collections. Drupal Drupal is an open source content management system (CMS) written in PHP. Known for being extremely flexible and extensible, Drupal is supported by a community of over 630,000 users and developers. Drupal sites can be customized and themed in a wide variety of ways. Drupal functions as the front-end of Islandora. Drupal Core The files, themes, profiles, and modules included with the standard project software download. Drupal Roles Roles are a way of assigning specific permissions to a group of users. Any user assigned to a role will have the same permissions as all other users assigned to that role. This allows you to control which users have permission to view, edit, or delete content in Drupal. Islandora provides a special role called fedoraAdmin that is required to have actions in Drupal reflected in Fedora. Entity A Drupal term for an item of either content or configuration data, although in common usage, the term often refers to content entities. Examples include content items, custom blocks, taxonomy terms, and definitions of content types; the first three are content entities, and the last is a configuration entity. Fedora (Repository Software) Fedora is a digital asset management architecture upon which institutional repositories, digital archives, and digital library systems might be built. Fedora is the underlying architecture for a digital repository, and is not a complete management, indexing, discovery, and delivery application. The Fedora repository functions as the standard smart storage for Islandora. Field Data of a certain type that is attached to a content entity. For instance, on a Resource Node content type, you might have fields for a title, description, display hints, subjects, and other metadata. Flysystem Flysystem is a filesystem abstraction library for PHP. Islandora uses Flysystem to swap about different backend filesystem applications. Islandora provides a custom Flysystem adapter for Fedora. Ingest To ingest an object is to add an entry for it in Islandora. This is done primarily through the Drupal interface. The word 'ingest' is used in repository language because repository software, rather than having an object and associated components forced upon it, takes in and processes the object itself, creating derivatives automatically. Often, when referring to the process of ingesting objects, Islandora and its associated documentation use other terms such as 'import' or 'add resource node'. In such contexts, these terms generally refer to the ingest process. Media A drop-in replacement for the Drupal core upload field with a unified User Interface where editors and administrators can upload, manage, and reuse files and multimedia assets. Microservice A software development technique \u2014 a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) structural style \u2014 that arranges an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight. Module Software (usually PHP, JavaScript, and/or CSS) that extends site features and adds functionality. Drupal modules conform to a specific structure allowing them to integrate with the Drupal architecture. Node A node is any piece of individual content, such as a page, article, forum topic, or a blog entry. All content on a Drupal website is stored and treated as \"nodes\". For information about nodes specific to Islandora, see \"Resource Node.\" Open Source Open source describes a method of software development that promotes access to the end product's source code. Islandora is an open source product with an active development community, operating under the GPL license (2.0) for Drupal components and the MIT license for non-Drupal components. Resource Node A resource node is a Drupal node that represents a single conceptual item or object stored in an Islandora repository. It acts as a container for all files and metadata associated with that item, and is the place where the item 'lives' as a visitable url. For example, A video stored in Islandora will have a resource node, which metadata stored in fields, a preservation master file, and may have a thumbnail, web-friendly derivatives, and technical metadata associated with the resource node. The resource node may also belong to one or more collections. Taxonomy term A term used to classify content, such as a tag or a category. Theme Software and asset files (images, CSS, PHP code, and/or templates) that determine the style and layout of the site. The Drupal project distinguishes between core and contributed themes. View A database query used to generate lists or tables of content. Drupal provides a powerful administrator interface for creating and editing views without any coding. Viewer A \"Viewer\" is an add-on package that allows a solution pack to embed, display, or playback a particular object in a web accessible format. Viewers are typically a combination of a Drupal Library and a Drupal Module. The Drupal Library is the package of code that represents the player or display mechanism, and the Drupal Module is the code package that allows the Drupal Library to be accessed from within the Drupal environment. Virtual Machine Image The Virtual Machine Image allows you to mount a fully working version of Islandora on your local machine as a separate virtual machine.

To use this Context, all that is required is for your book or newspaper (or other paged content) to be given a model of \"Paged Content\" or \"Publication Issue\". Then, in the Openseadragon Block Context, make sure the term used in the \"Node has term\" condition (you can register more than one term there). Now, when you view a paged content Islandora object, you will see thumbnails of all of its child pages (assuming you have added some child pages to the object) in the OpenSeadragon viewer as illustrated above. You can change how the paged content thumbnails are arranged in the OpenSeadragon viewport by doing the following: Visit admin/config/media/openseadragon Scroll to the bottom, where you will see the \"Collection Mode\" options. The \"Enable Collection Mode\" checkbox will be unchecked. This is normal (unless you have already checked it). The Openseadragon Context automatically, and temporarily, puts OpenSeadragon in Collection mode when rendering a Paged Content object and then puts it back to Sequence mode (which is what mode it's in when the \"Enable Collection Mode\" checkbox is unchecked). This means that in order for you to change options that apply to Collection Mode, you will need to check the \"Enable Collection Mode\" checkbox, change its options, save the form, then uncheck the \"Enable Collection Mode\" checkbox again. Just follow these steps, and it will work! Check the \"Enable Collection Mode\" checkbox. The Collection Mode options will appear. Adjust the options to what you want.

Those who make their way through the readings will be able to talk competently about linked data and better understand the design decisions made in Islandora 8. The list starts with the fundamentals of linked data (RDF, SPARQL, serializations and ontologies) and moves toward more advanced topics specific to the use cases of a Fedora 4 based digital repository system. Basics of Linked Data This section seeks to give the reader a foundational understanding of what linked data is, why it is useful, and a very superficial understanding of how it works.

The queryable nature of linked data is one of the things that makes it so special. Try some SPARQL queries on DBpedia's endpoint to get some hands-on experience. Wikipedia article on SPARQL W3C\u2019s SPARQL 1.1 Overview W3C\u2019s SPARQL 1.1 Query Language DBpedia's SPARQL Endpoint RDF Serialization Formats RDF data can be translated into many different formats. RDF/XML is the original way that RDF data was shared, but there are much more human-friendly serialization formats like Turtle which is great for beginners.

Drupal uses a media's fields to store information about the media's file, such as file size, width and height (for images), alt text (for images), creation date, and so on. Compared to Islandora 7 In Islandora 7, this sort of technical metadata would have been stored as datastream properties or as additional metadata-specific datastreams. In Islandora 8, each datastream holds its technical metadata using an associated media entity. Fedora will store the media's file as a binary resource and use the media's properties as the binary resource's description. For example, creating a media with a file named test.jpg (in November 2019) will create a Fedora binary resource of the file accessible at /fcrepo/rest/2019-11/test.jpg with the media's fields accessible at /fcrepo/rest/2019-11/test.jpg/fcr:metadata . Media revisions The metadata associated with a file can be updated by clicking the Edit tab while on the media's page and clicking Save . The Create new revision checkbox is selected by default which will prompt Fedora to make a new version of the media's metadata before updating its resource record. A message can be added to the revision which is stored in Drupal but is not currently saved in Fedora. Do not replace a media's file The media edit form allows a user to remove a file and replace it with a new one. However, because of the relationship Islandora creates between a file and its media, the effects of removing a file and uploading a new one are not obvious. First, the remove button removes the file's reference on the media but does not delete the file. This leaves the file in Fedora. Second, because Drupal does not want users to reuse a file path uploading a file, even with the same name in the same month, Drupal will rename the file for you resulting in a new binary resource in Fedora. Third, because the new file is now associated with the media, the media will now be used to represent the metadata for the new file and will no longer be used for the existing one. Replacing Media via REST REST can circumvent Drupal form behavior making it possible to add and replace media and files via Islandora's REST interface . Media Ownership Islandora 8 objects can have any number of media associated with them. Media store a reference to the resource node they belong to using a special field, \"Media Of\". By changing this field's value, you can change which resource node owns the media, and therefore, where it gets displayed or managed. Compared to Islandora 7 The direction of the relationship between objects and datastreams is reversed when compared to Islandora 7. Generally speaking, objects are unaware of their datastreams, and it's a Drupal view that lists datastreams for an object. Media Use Islandora 8 media express their intended use with a special \"Media Use\" field, which accepts taxonomy terms from the \"Media Usage\" vocabulary. Because the Media Usage vocabulary is an ordinary Drupal vocabulary, Islandora 8 site administrators can create additional terms, and in turn, these local terms can be used to identify media that have some custom local purpose. However, most of the default set of \"Media Use\" terms are taken from the PCDM Use Extension vocabulary: Compared to Islandora 7 Terms from the Media Usage vocabulary are very similar to DSIDs in Islandora 7. The only difference is that a DSID is immutable, but a media's usage can be changed at any time through the media's edit form. Derivatives Islandora generates derivatives based on the Media Use term selected for a Media and the Model of the node that owns it. All of this is configurable using Context. By default, derivatives are generated from Media with the \"Original Files\" term selected. When an Original File is uploaded, if the node that owns it has an \"Image\" model, image derivatives are created. If it's a \"Video\", then video derivatives are generated, etc... By default, derivatives are created with a path determined by the current year, current month, the associated resource node' identifier assigned by Drupal, and the type of derivative. For example, a resource node found at node/2 with a service file media generated in October 2019 will have the path \"2019-10/2-Service File.jpg\". Naming conventions can be configured by editing each derivative action's File path settings. Within a node's media tab, you can see all of its media, including derivatives, listed along with their usage.

This allows us to interact with metadata (add, edit, remove, display, index in a search engine...) almost entirely using standard Drupal processes. If exporting this metadata to Fedora and/or a triplestore, the values are serialized to RDF using mappings that can be set for each bundle. Drupal 8 Terminology In Drupal 8, Fields can be attached to bundles (sometimes called entity sub-types -- e.g. Content types, Media types, Vocabularies) or entities (e.g. Users). For more on Fields, see \"2.3 Content Entities and Fields\" and \"6.3 Adding Basic Fields to a Content Type\" in the Official Drupal Guide. As described in the resource nodes section , Islandora 8 digital objects are comprised of Drupal nodes for descriptive metadata, Drupal media for technical metadata, and Drupal files for the binary objects. This section describes how Islandora 8 uses and extends Drupal fields to manage descriptive metadata. Content Types In Drupal, Nodes come in different sub-types called Content Types (e.g. Article, Basic page, Repository item). Content types contain fields, and configurations for how those fields can be edited or displayed. Each content type is essentially a metadata profile that can be used for a piece of web content, or to describe a digital resource. For each field in a content type, an administrator can configure how data is entered, how it can be displayed, how many values can be stored, and how long the value can be. Some configurations, such as data entry and display, can be changed at any time. Others, such as how long a value can be or what options are available in a select list, cannot be changed once content has been created without first deleting all content of that type. However, fields can be added to existing content types with no consequence. For example, the 'islandora_defaults' module provides a Repository Item content type that defines many fields including \"Alternative Title\" and \"Date Issued\". Under the management menu for Repository Item you can see a list of the fields it includes (\"Manage fields\") as well as tabs for changing the input forms (\"Manage form display\") and display modes (\"Manage display\"). See the \" Create / Update a Content Type \" section for more details on creating and configuring fields. Titles aren't fields. Note that the \"Title\" field does not appear in this list. It is a built-in part of every content type. You can edit the label of this \"field\" if you want it called something other than \"Title\" under the \"Edit\" tab for that content type. This built-in title \"field\" is limited to 255 characters; if your content has longer titles it is encouraged to create a separate long_title field to store the full title and reserve the default title field for a display title. There is a contributed module called Node Title Length , which allows an administrator to configure the length of the title field in the core node table. However, this only works on nodes (not media or other entities) and involves meddling in a core Drupal database schema, which makes some people uneasy. 7.x Migration Note: What about my XML? In 7.x, metadata were usually stored using an XML schema such as MODS or DC, as datastreams attached to an object. In Islandora 8, metadata is stored as fields. This means we are breaking out individual elements from a hierarchical structure to being individual independent values. Where some hierarchy or field grouping is necessary, this can be done in Drupal using Paragraphs , a widely-used Drupal contrib module. At the moment (Nov 2019) we are working on the technical challenge of mapping data from paragraphs into RDF in Fedora. The Metadata Interest Group has developed a default mapping ( spreadsheet , guidance document ) which provides a basic, yet customizable, transform between MODS metadata and Drupal fields in Islandora Defaults. It is suggested that individual institutions customize the mapping to meet their unique needs. That said, if keeping the \"legacy\" XML metadata from 7.x is important to you, it can be attached to an Islandora 8 resource node as a Media entity. However, there is no mechanism in Islandora 8 for editing XML in a user-friendly way. When you create a node (i.e. an instantiation of a content type, such as by using Drupal's \"Add Content\" workflow), the fields defined by its content type become available. Once a node is created, its content type cannot be changed. To \"switch\" a node to a different content type, a repository manager would need to create a new node of the target content type, map the field values (programmatically or by copy-paste), and update any Media or children that refer to the old node to refer to the new one. Not all content types in your Drupal site need be Islandora \"resource nodes\". A \"resource node\" content type will likely have behaviours (such as syncing to Fedora or causing derivatives to be generated) associated with it. This configuration, and the communication to the user of which content types are and are not considered to be Islandora resource nodes is left to the discretion of the site manager. In Islandora, a \"resource node\" is usually considered a descriptive record for \"a thing\", and is conceptually similar to an \"Islandora Object\" in 7.x, i.e. a \"Fedora Object\" in Fedora 3.x and below. Vocabularies In Drupal, Taxonomy Vocabularies (or simply Vocabularies ) are also entity sub-types that define a set of fields and their configurations. Whereas instances of content types are called nodes , items in a vocabulary are called taxonomy terms (or simply terms ). Traditionally, taxonomy terms are used to classify content in Drupal. For instance, the Article content type includes a field field_tags that can refer to terms in the Tags vocabulary. There are two ways that users can interact with taxonomies: they can be \"closed,\" e.g. a fixed list to pick from in a dropdown, or \"open,\" e.g. field_tags where users can enter new terms, which are created on the fly. This is not set on the vocabulary itself, but in the configuration of the field (typically on a node). Terms within vocabularies have an ordering, and can have hierarchical structure, but do not need to. Islandora (through the Islandora Core Feature) creates the 'Islandora Models' vocabulary which includes the terms 'Audio', 'Binary', 'Collection', 'Digital Document', 'Image', 'Page', 'Paged Content', 'Publication Issue', and 'Video'. Islandora Defaults provides contexts that cause certain actions (e.g. derivatives to happen, or blocks to appear) based on which term is used. The Controlled Access Terms module provides additional vocabularies: - Corporate Body - Country - Family - Form - Genre - Geographic Location - Language - Person - Resource Types - Subject Each of these vocabularies has its own set of fields allowing repositories to further describe them. The Repository Item content type has fields that can reference terms in these vocabularies. See 'Entity Reference fields' in the 'Field Types' section below. The vocabularies provided by default are a starting point, and a repository administrator can create whatever vocabularies are desired. Field Types Fields are where Drupal entities store their data. There are different types of fields including boolean, datetime, entity reference, integer, string, text, and text_with_summary. These field types also have widgets (controlling how data is entered) and formatters (controlling how data is displayed). The Drupal 8 documentation on FieldTypes, FieldWidgets, and FieldFormatters includes a list of the core field types. Modules can provide their own field types, formatters, and widgets. The Controlled Access Terms module provides two additional types for use with Islandora: ETDF, and Typed Relation. These are described below. Entity Reference fields are a special type of field built into Drupal that creates a relationship between two entities. The field's configuration options include which kind of entities can be referenced. The 'Repository Item' content type, provided by islandora_defaults, includes several entity reference fields that reference vocabularies defined by the islandora and controlled_access_terms modules. The 'Member Of' field is an entity reference field, defined by Islandora, which is the Islandora way of imposing a hierarchical order on resource nodes. This can be used to show membership in a collection, for pages that are members of a paged item, and for members of a complex object. EDTF The EDTF field type is for recording dates in Extended Date Time Format , which is a format based off of the hyphenated form of ISO 8601 (e.g. 1991-02-03 or 1991-02-03T10:00:00), but also allows expressions of different granularity and uncertainty. The Default EDTF widget has a validator that only allows strings that conform to the EDTF standard. The Default EDTF formatter allows these date string to be displayed in a variety of human readable ways, including big- or little-endian, and presenting months as numbers, abbreviations, or spelling month names out in full. When configuring the EDTF widget for a field in a content type, you can choose to allow date intervals, but doing this prevents the widget from accepting values that include times. (The EDTF standard states that date intervals cannot contain times, but the field should be able to accept either a valid EDTF range or a valid EDTF datetime, so this is a bug.) Example of valid inputs in a multi-valued EDTF Date field: Example of the same EDTF dates displayed using little-endian format: Example of a valid EDTF value ('1943-05') and an invalid value ('1943 May') with the corresponding error message: The configuration for the Default EDTF Widget (including options for extra strict date validation, and allowing date intervals and date sets). Example of how the EDTF formatter settings can change the display of an EDTF value: Typed Relation A Typed Relation field is an extension of Drupal's Entity Reference field, which allows the user to qualify the relation. It was created for describing a resource's contributors (modelled as taxonomy terms or some other Drupal entities) as well as their roles in this resource node (such as 'author', 'illustrator', or 'architect'). With only Drupal's Entity Reference fields, we would need individual fields for 'author', 'illustrator', 'architect', and any other roles that may need to be made available. Using a Typed Relation field, we can have one field for \"Contributors\" and let the user pick the role from a dropdown list. Nerd note: The parts of a field are called properties, so 'entity reference' and 'relation type' are properties of the Typed Relation field type. Islandora Defaults provides a 'Linked Agent' field as part of the Repository Item content type, and populates the available relationships from the MARC relators list. The list of available relations for this field is configurable at '/admin/structure/types/manage/islandora_object/fields/node.islandora_object.field_linked_agent'. If you re-use this existing field on another content type, you can define different available relations for that instance of the field. Relations are defined in the format key|value , and the key is used in the RDF mapping (see below). Typed Relation fields and mapping to RDF: Unlike other fields, which can be assigned RDF predicates in RDF Mapping yaml files, a typed relation field uses a different predicate depending on the chosen \"type\". These predicates are assigned using the 'keys' in the key|value configuration. The key must be formated namespace:predicate , e.g. relators:act . The namespace ('relators') must be pre-defined in code, using a hook. See the RDF Mapping section of Create / Update a Content Type for more details, including a list of available pre-defined namespaces. Getting Metadata into Fedora and a Triple-store The above sections described how Drupal manages and stores metadata, but Islandora 8 provides for pushing that metadata into a Fedora 4+ repository and a triple-store. Islandora does this by using Drupal's serialization capabilities to provide a JSON-LD serialization that can be ingested by Fedora 4+ repository and triple-stores. In response to actions taken as a result of if-then configurations in Contexts , Islandora sends notifications to the repository and triple-store that an entity available to ingest. The JSON-LD module (written for Islandora) takes an entity and its corresponding RDF mapping (a structure defined by the contributed RDF module) to create a JSON-LD serialization. An RDF mapping for a content type, media type, or vocabulary lists its fields and the RDF predicates that should be used for them. The JSON-LD serialization for an entity is available by appending ?_format=jsonld to the entity's URL. This particular syntax takes advantage of the REST API module. Below is an example JSONLD document representing the RDF serialization of a Repository item node created in a standard islandora-playbook based vagrant VM: { \"@graph\":[ { \"@id\":\"http://localhost:8000/node/1\", \"@type\":[ \"http://pcdm.org/models#Object\" ], \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/title\":[ { \"@value\":\"New York, New York.

However, fields can be added to existing content types with no consequence. For example, the 'islandora_defaults' module provides a Repository Item content type that defines many fields including \"Alternative Title\" and \"Date Issued\". Under the management menu for Repository Item you can see a list of the fields it includes (\"Manage fields\") as well as tabs for changing the input forms (\"Manage form display\") and display modes (\"Manage display\"). See the \" Create / Update a Content Type \" section for more details on creating and configuring fields. Titles aren't fields. Note that the \"Title\" field does not appear in this list. It is a built-in part of every content type. You can edit the label of this \"field\" if you want it called something other than \"Title\" under the \"Edit\" tab for that content type. This built-in title \"field\" is limited to 255 characters; if your content has longer titles it is encouraged to create a separate long_title field to store the full title and reserve the default title field for a display title. There is a contributed module called Node Title Length , which allows an administrator to configure the length of the title field in the core node table. However, this only works on nodes (not media or other entities) and involves meddling in a core Drupal database schema, which makes some people uneasy. 7.x Migration Note: What about my XML? In 7.x, metadata were usually stored using an XML schema such as MODS or DC, as datastreams attached to an object. In Islandora 8, metadata is stored as fields. This means we are breaking out individual elements from a hierarchical structure to being individual independent values. Where some hierarchy or field grouping is necessary, this can be done in Drupal using Paragraphs , a widely-used Drupal contrib module. At the moment (Nov 2019) we are working on the technical challenge of mapping data from paragraphs into RDF in Fedora. The Metadata Interest Group has developed a default mapping ( spreadsheet , guidance document ) which provides a basic, yet customizable, transform between MODS metadata and Drupal fields in Islandora Defaults. It is suggested that individual institutions customize the mapping to meet their unique needs. That said, if keeping the \"legacy\" XML metadata from 7.x is important to you, it can be attached to an Islandora 8 resource node as a Media entity. However, there is no mechanism in Islandora 8 for editing XML in a user-friendly way. When you create a node (i.e. an instantiation of a content type, such as by using Drupal's \"Add Content\" workflow), the fields defined by its content type become available. Once a node is created, its content type cannot be changed. To \"switch\" a node to a different content type, a repository manager would need to create a new node of the target content type, map the field values (programmatically or by copy-paste), and update any Media or children that refer to the old node to refer to the new one. Not all content types in your Drupal site need be Islandora \"resource nodes\". A \"resource node\" content type will likely have behaviours (such as syncing to Fedora or causing derivatives to be generated) associated with it. This configuration, and the communication to the user of which content types are and are not considered to be Islandora resource nodes is left to the discretion of the site manager. In Islandora, a \"resource node\" is usually considered a descriptive record for \"a thing\", and is conceptually similar to an \"Islandora Object\" in 7.x, i.e. a \"Fedora Object\" in Fedora 3.x and below.","title":"Content Types"},{"location":"user-documentation/metadata/#vocabularies","text":"In Drupal, Taxonomy Vocabularies (or simply Vocabularies ) are also entity sub-types that define a set of fields and their configurations. Whereas instances of content types are called nodes , items in a vocabulary are called taxonomy terms (or simply terms ). Traditionally, taxonomy terms are used to classify content in Drupal. For instance, the Article content type includes a field field_tags that can refer to terms in the Tags vocabulary. There are two ways that users can interact with taxonomies: they can be \"closed,\" e.g. a fixed list to pick from in a dropdown, or \"open,\" e.g. field_tags where users can enter new terms, which are created on the fly. This is not set on the vocabulary itself, but in the configuration of the field (typically on a node). Terms within vocabularies have an ordering, and can have hierarchical structure, but do not need to. Islandora (through the Islandora Core Feature) creates the 'Islandora Models' vocabulary which includes the terms 'Audio', 'Binary', 'Collection', 'Digital Document', 'Image', 'Page', 'Paged Content', 'Publication Issue', and 'Video'. Islandora Defaults provides contexts that cause certain actions (e.g. derivatives to happen, or blocks to appear) based on which term is used. The Controlled Access Terms module provides additional vocabularies: - Corporate Body - Country - Family - Form - Genre - Geographic Location - Language - Person - Resource Types - Subject Each of these vocabularies has its own set of fields allowing repositories to further describe them. The Repository Item content type has fields that can reference terms in these vocabularies. See 'Entity Reference fields' in the 'Field Types' section below. The vocabularies provided by default are a starting point, and a repository administrator can create whatever vocabularies are desired.","title":"Vocabularies"},{"location":"user-documentation/metadata/#field-types","text":"Fields are where Drupal entities store their data. There are different types of fields including boolean, datetime, entity reference, integer, string, text, and text_with_summary. These field types also have widgets (controlling how data is entered) and formatters (controlling how data is displayed). The Drupal 8 documentation on FieldTypes, FieldWidgets, and FieldFormatters includes a list of the core field types. Modules can provide their own field types, formatters, and widgets. The Controlled Access Terms module provides two additional types for use with Islandora: ETDF, and Typed Relation. These are described below. Entity Reference fields are a special type of field built into Drupal that creates a relationship between two entities. The field's configuration options include which kind of entities can be referenced. The 'Repository Item' content type, provided by islandora_defaults, includes several entity reference fields that reference vocabularies defined by the islandora and controlled_access_terms modules. The 'Member Of' field is an entity reference field, defined by Islandora, which is the Islandora way of imposing a hierarchical order on resource nodes. This can be used to show membership in a collection, for pages that are members of a paged item, and for members of a complex object.","title":"Field Types"},{"location":"user-documentation/metadata/#edtf","text":"The EDTF field type is for recording dates in Extended Date Time Format , which is a format based off of the hyphenated form of ISO 8601 (e.g. 1991-02-03 or 1991-02-03T10:00:00), but also allows expressions of different granularity and uncertainty. The Default EDTF widget has a validator that only allows strings that conform to the EDTF standard. The Default EDTF formatter allows these date string to be displayed in a variety of human readable ways, including big- or little-endian, and presenting months as numbers, abbreviations, or spelling month names out in full. When configuring the EDTF widget for a field in a content type, you can choose to allow date intervals, but doing this prevents the widget from accepting values that include times. (The EDTF standard states that date intervals cannot contain times, but the field should be able to accept either a valid EDTF range or a valid EDTF datetime, so this is a bug.) Example of valid inputs in a multi-valued EDTF Date field: Example of the same EDTF dates displayed using little-endian format: Example of a valid EDTF value ('1943-05') and an invalid value ('1943 May') with the corresponding error message: The configuration for the Default EDTF Widget (including options for extra strict date validation, and allowing date intervals and date sets).

It was created for describing a resource's contributors (modelled as taxonomy terms or some other Drupal entities) as well as their roles in this resource node (such as 'author', 'illustrator', or 'architect'). With only Drupal's Entity Reference fields, we would need individual fields for 'author', 'illustrator', 'architect', and any other roles that may need to be made available. Using a Typed Relation field, we can have one field for \"Contributors\" and let the user pick the role from a dropdown list. Nerd note: The parts of a field are called properties, so 'entity reference' and 'relation type' are properties of the Typed Relation field type. Islandora Defaults provides a 'Linked Agent' field as part of the Repository Item content type, and populates the available relationships from the MARC relators list. The list of available relations for this field is configurable at '/admin/structure/types/manage/islandora_object/fields/node.islandora_object.field_linked_agent'. If you re-use this existing field on another content type, you can define different available relations for that instance of the field. Relations are defined in the format key|value , and the key is used in the RDF mapping (see below). Typed Relation fields and mapping to RDF: Unlike other fields, which can be assigned RDF predicates in RDF Mapping yaml files, a typed relation field uses a different predicate depending on the chosen \"type\". These predicates are assigned using the 'keys' in the key|value configuration. The key must be formated namespace:predicate , e.g. relators:act . The namespace ('relators') must be pre-defined in code, using a hook.

In response to actions taken as a result of if-then configurations in Contexts , Islandora sends notifications to the repository and triple-store that an entity available to ingest. The JSON-LD module (written for Islandora) takes an entity and its corresponding RDF mapping (a structure defined by the contributed RDF module) to create a JSON-LD serialization. An RDF mapping for a content type, media type, or vocabulary lists its fields and the RDF predicates that should be used for them. The JSON-LD serialization for an entity is available by appending ?_format=jsonld to the entity's URL. This particular syntax takes advantage of the REST API module.

Building resources in Islandora 8 Islandora 8 represents a fundamental shift forward from Islandora 7. Islandora 8 turns what are known as traditional Islandora objects into Drupal nodes. It is possible to manipulate all aspects of objects through the Drupal user interface. Non-developers can configure and set up a myriad of content and functions in Islandora that enhance the discovery of and support access to objects in the repository. Improving the discovery of and access to objects is a significant theme in Islandora. Another difference between Islandora 7 and 8 are Islandora objects. In Islandora 7, objects (video files, audio files, PDFs, etc.) are loaded through the user interface, and Datastreams are generated automatically. These consist of access and display copies, the metadata, OCH/HOCR, technical metadata, and more. All of these Datastreams are directly connected to the object and accessed through the admin interface. In Islandora 8, the traditional Islandora 7 objects (video files, audio files, etc.) are now Drupal nodes . Islandora object nodes are a special kind of Drupal node, distinct from nodes that exist for other content types such as a blog post, an article, a page (like the About page on a site), and others. These Islandora objects are still loaded through the interface and described with the data entry form and derivatives are still generated. However, the Datastreams are no longer connected to the original object in the same immutable way. Each of these Datastreams can be manipulated through Drupal by non-developers. You can create a variety of ways to view this metadata and information related to the objects. Doing so requires knowledge of Drupal 8, but this essentially means that there are many ways to view the metadata and access the related objects in Islandora 8. Traditional objects become resource nodes Until now we have thought of objects in Islandora 8 in the conventional Islandora 7 way: A file loaded in the repository with associated derivatives. It can be helpful to move away from this when learning about Islandora 8. One way to do this is to think of objects in Islandora 8 as resource nodes . While using the term \u201cobject\u201d is traditional with Islandora it can get in the way of understanding the differences and possibilities in Islandora 8. Using the term \u201cresource node\u201d reflects the fact that files such as JPEGs, MP3s, .zip, etc. that get loaded through the data entry (formerly ingest) form are now fully integrated within Drupal and can take advantage of everything that represents. The term resource node does not just refer to the individual files, however. The term reflects the new nature of objects in Islandora 8. A resource node encompasses multiple elements that all relate to each other, even if they are no longer directly connected like objects in Islandora 7. The typical elements of a resource node: Content types (one or more) Media files (the actual files of JPEGs, MP3s, .zip, etc.) that get loaded through the form Metadata fields submitted in the data entry, for example: A field denoting the 'type' of thing you're persisting (image, book, newspaper, etc...) A field that creates the familiar collection hierarchy Descriptive custom fields Derivative files (thumbnails, web-friendly service files, technical metadata, and more) It is possible to configure all elements of a resource node in Islandora 8. This fact allows full control over how one accesses the node and how nodes are displayed and discovered online. It also allows a repository to take full advantage of all third-party Drupal modules, themes, and distributions available. Islandora 8: Empowering resource nodes through Drupal These resource nodes are what the librarian, student, archivist, technician, or general non-developer creates through the data entry form. It is a lot more than just the file (JPEG, .MP3, etc.). This user is creating the node and elements that make it possible to access, manage, and preserve the resource. Islandora 8 is all about empowering this access to repository resources. It makes it possible to touch and manipulate the file itself and the elements that make it a wholly preserved and shareable digital object. This shift is actually at the core of Digital Asset Management (DAM) and librarianship \u2013 making things accessible. Islandora 8 is about doing that through Drupal 8 and the web, making it that much more available, flexible, and viable for the future. It does this by making more elements of what was a traditional DAM object configurable and manageable by more users \u2013 non-developers . Work is ongoing by the community to increase the ease of use of the admin user interface to make this even more feasible. Concept: Resource node discovery attributes Discovery attributes would include metadata fields, fields that define the collection hierarchy/structure, and any custom fields. They are any attributes of the resource node element that help manage how the resource node can be discovered through the interface and accessed by the public online. For example, the following are discovery attributes: Concept: Resource node management attributes Management attributes of the resource node help to clarify and manage its relationship within the repository and to other content. Management attributes define if a node is a resource node, which collection it belongs to, the type of resource a node is (image, book, newspaper, etc.), and similar actions. When looking at Drupal functions, the following are examples of management attributes: Content types Default content types available include article, basic page, repository item, video Ability to add any content type needed to help define the resource node Drupal Views Manages the display of all aspects of the resource node More Information The following pages expand on the concepts discussed above: Resource Nodes Media Make an Image Content Types Copyright and Usage This document was originally developed by Alex Kent and has been adapted for general use by the Islandora community.","title":"From Objects to Resource Nodes"},{"location":"user-documentation/objects_to_resource_nodes/#building-resources-in-islandora-8","text":"Islandora 8 represents a fundamental shift forward from Islandora 7.

Islandora object nodes are a special kind of Drupal node, distinct from nodes that exist for other content types such as a blog post, an article, a page (like the About page on a site), and others. These Islandora objects are still loaded through the interface and described with the data entry form and derivatives are still generated. However, the Datastreams are no longer connected to the original object in the same immutable way. Each of these Datastreams can be manipulated through Drupal by non-developers. You can create a variety of ways to view this metadata and information related to the objects. Doing so requires knowledge of Drupal 8, but this essentially means that there are many ways to view the metadata and access the related objects in Islandora 8.","title":"Building resources in Islandora 8"},{"location":"user-documentation/objects_to_resource_nodes/#traditional-objects-become-resource-nodes","text":"Until now we have thought of objects in Islandora 8 in the conventional Islandora 7 way: A file loaded in the repository with associated derivatives. It can be helpful to move away from this when learning about Islandora 8. One way to do this is to think of objects in Islandora 8 as resource nodes . While using the term \u201cobject\u201d is traditional with Islandora it can get in the way of understanding the differences and possibilities in Islandora 8. Using the term \u201cresource node\u201d reflects the fact that files such as JPEGs, MP3s, .zip, etc. that get loaded through the data entry (formerly ingest) form are now fully integrated within Drupal and can take advantage of everything that represents. The term resource node does not just refer to the individual files, however. The term reflects the new nature of objects in Islandora 8. A resource node encompasses multiple elements that all relate to each other, even if they are no longer directly connected like objects in Islandora 7. The typical elements of a resource node: Content types (one or more) Media files (the actual files of JPEGs, MP3s, .zip, etc.) that get loaded through the form Metadata fields submitted in the data entry, for example: A field denoting the 'type' of thing you're persisting (image, book, newspaper, etc...) A field that creates the familiar collection hierarchy Descriptive custom fields Derivative files (thumbnails, web-friendly service files, technical metadata, and more) It is possible to configure all elements of a resource node in Islandora 8. This fact allows full control over how one accesses the node and how nodes are displayed and discovered online. It also allows a repository to take full advantage of all third-party Drupal modules, themes, and distributions available.","title":"Traditional objects become resource nodes"},{"location":"user-documentation/objects_to_resource_nodes/#islandora-8-empowering-resource-nodes-through-drupal","text":"These resource nodes are what the librarian, student, archivist, technician, or general non-developer creates through the data entry form.

Islandora 8 is all about empowering this access to repository resources. It makes it possible to touch and manipulate the file itself and the elements that make it a wholly preserved and shareable digital object. This shift is actually at the core of Digital Asset Management (DAM) and librarianship \u2013 making things accessible. Islandora 8 is about doing that through Drupal 8 and the web, making it that much more available, flexible, and viable for the future.

(See the section describing resource node membership .) This involves creating a resource node for the root record (e.g. the book or the photograph) and child resource nodes for each sub-component (e.g. \"Page 1\" and \"Page 2\" or \"recto\" and \"verso\") with their corresponding media. Each \"child\" resource node contains a reference to their \"parent\" resource node using the field_member_of property. Child v. Member Islandora 8 uses the \"child\" and \"member\" descriptor for resource nodes that store a reference to another resource node in the \"Member Of\" field interchangeably. Administrators will more often see the \"member\" terminology more often while front-end users will usually see \"child\" terminology. Similar to the collection view showing members of a collection, Islandora provides an Islandora Model terms, Paged Content and Page , that can be used to trigger paged content behaviors. Islandora Defaults provides a Context for Paged Content resource nodes to trigger displaying an OpenSeadragon viewer showing the child resource nodes' service files. To enable this, use the Paged Content for the Islandora Model of the parent resource node and Page for the Islandora Model of the child resource node. After the child resource nodes have services file Media (either generated via the built-in derivative creation or added manually), they will be included in the OpenSeadragon paginated viewer displayed on the parent resource node's page. (See the IIIF Documentation for more details on controlling the viewer's behavior.) However, repository managers can use any method they like, such as a view-based list of teasers, a gallery, or a slide-show to display child resource nodes. By default child resource nodes are un-ordered. To order the sub-components of a paged content resource node, Islandora provides a Weight field to store a integer value on child resource nodes. Children resource nodes with smaller weight values will come before child resource nodes with larger weight values. This follows the usual ordering pattern of 1 (smaller) coming before 2 (larger). Weight values do not need to be sequential, just ordered from smallest to largest. For example, the first child resource node can have a value of 10 and the next could have a value of 20 and they will be ordered accordingly. Should a new child be added with the weight value of 15 it will automatically be sorted after the child with the weight value 10 and before the child with the weight value 20 . Child resource nodes can be reordered using a drag-and-drop interface by clicking on the Re-order Children button on the Children tab of the parent resource node. Re-ordering children resource nodes on this page and clicking Save will cause each child resource node's weight value to be updated using sequential values. Why not Drupal's book or weight modules? Drupal provides the book module in core for creating multi-level ordered content, such as books and manuals. However, this module stores structure and pagination separately from the nodes making serializing these relationships as RDF we can provide to Fedora more difficult than simply using field_member_of with an RDF mapping. Support for the book module may be added in the future. Drupal also has a weight module that provides a weight field and a drag-and-drop reordering user-interface. However, this module requires users to set a specified range of values which includes their negative corresponding value. E.g. a range setting of '20' will require all children to have a value between '-20' to '20'. This presumes a repository manager can predict how many pages the largest paged content item in their repository will be beforehand. Also, these weight values are serialized into RDF using the Collections Ontology 'index' predicate which assumes positive integer values which cannot be guaranteed using the weight module.","title":"Paged Content"},{"location":"user-documentation/resource-nodes/","text":"As we learned in the introduction , objects in an Islandora repository are represented as a combination of resource nodes, media, and files in Drupal. Because of this, their metadata profile, display, form (and much more) are configurable through the Drupal UI. This gives repository administrators a huge degree of control over their repository without any need for coding. Much more so than ever before. And since we're using a core Drupal solution for modeling our resource nodes and media, compatibility with third-party modules is virtually guaranteed. This opens up a plethora of solutions from the Drupal community that will save you untold time and effort when implementing your repository with Islandora. Properties Resource nodes have some basic properties that are common to all nodes, regardless of its content type. These properties are not fields. This means that they cannot be removed and have limited configurability. Their name, what type of data they hold, etc... are all baked in. Here's an example of the basic properties on nodes: nid: 1 uid: 1 title: \"I am an Islandora 8 object\" created: 1550703004 changed: 1550703512 uuid: 02932f2c-e4c2-4b7e-95e1-4aceab78c638 type: islandora_object status: 1 As you can see, it's all system data used at the Drupal level to track the basics. Property Value nid The local ID for the node uuid The global ID for any entity title The title for the node created Timestamp of when the node was created changed Timestamp of when the node was last updated type Content type (e.g. which group of fields are present on the node) status Published, unpublished, etc... Compared to Islandora 7 These node properties directly correspond to following Islandora 7.x object properties: Islandora 7 Islandora 8 owner uid dc.title title PID uuid status status The small amount of configurability available for these properties is found on the content type editing form where a user can choose to change the label of the title field, whether or not to display author information on the node's page, etcetera. These settings will only apply to nodes of that particular content type. To view all of a node's property and field values administrators can use the 'Devel' tab's 'Load' section: Fields In addition to the basic node properties identified above, resource nodes (like all Drupal nodes) can have fields. Most of what we would think of as descriptive metadata is stored as fields. Resource nodes use 'content types' to define a specific set of required and optional fields it has; we can think of content types as metadata profiles for our objects. For example, you might have a content type for a set of repository objects that have very specialized metadata requirements but another content type for generic repository objects that share a more general set of metadata fields. A resource node's content type is set on its creation and is immutable. The section on metadata describes in more detail how fields on Islandora objects work. Islandora has a notion of a content model , which is used to identify what type of content is being represented by a node (e.g. an image, a video, a collection of other items, etc...). This is done using a special field, Model , which accepts taxonomy terms from the Islandora Models vocabulary. By applying a term from the Islandora Models vocabulary to a node, Islandora will become aware of how to handle the node in response to certain events, like choosing a viewer or generating derivatives. Compared to Islandora 7 Content models in Islandora 7 were immutable and contained restrictions as to what types of datastreams could be associated with an object. Islandora 8 imposes no such restrictions. Content models can be changed at any time, and they in no way dictate what types of media can be associated with a node. Media All resource nodes can be linked to any number of media. The media associated with a resource node can be managed using the \"Media\" tab when viewing a node. Much like the \"Members\" tab, Actions can be performed in bulk using the checkboxes and Actions dropdown. See the media section for more details. Display Hints Drupal uses \"View Modes\" to provide alternative ways to present content to users. You may be familiar with the \"full\" and \"teaser\" versions of nodes, which are rendered using two corresponding kinds of View modes. Islandora also uses view modes to control how media content is displayed. Islandora provides two view modes for Media, one which renders the OpenSeadragon viewer and the other which renders the PDFjs viewer. These two View modes can be set explicitly in the node edit form or you can configure Islandora to use a specific View mode for all media with a specific Mime type using Contexts . To set it explicitly on the resource node's edit form, simply check the View mode you want to use for that node in the Display hints field: The selected View mode will then be used when the resource node's page is rendered. At a global level, there are a couple of ways to tell Drupal to use the PDFjs viewer to render the content of the media field whenever the media has a Mime type of application/pdf . The first way is to edit the \"PDFjs\" Context. By default, this Context tells Drupal to use the PDFjs viewer if the node has the term \"PDFjs\" (yes, that's a taxonomy term): If you add the Condition \"Node has Media with Mime type\" and configure it to use application/pdf as the Mime type, like this: Context will use whichever Condition applies (as long as you don't check \"Require all conditions\"). That is, if the \"PDFjs\" display hint option in the node edit form is checked, or if the node's media has a Mime type of application/pdf , the media content will be rendered using the PDFjs viewer. The second way to use the media's Mime type to render its content with the PDFjs viewer is to create a separate Context that will detect the media's Mime type and use the configured View mode automatically. To do this, create a new Context. Add a \"Node has Media with Mime type\" condition and specify the Mime type, and then add a \"Change View mode\" Reaction that selects the desired view mode: Finally, save your Context. From that point on, whenever the media for a node has the configured Mime type, Drupal will render the media using the corresponding view mode. The node-level and global approaches are not exclusive to one another. One Context can override another depending on the order of execution. Whichever Condition applies last between the node-level Condition (which in this case is the \"Node has term\" condition) the global Condition (which is \"Node has Media with Mime type\"), that one will override the other. An example of having the View mode specified in the node edit form intentionally override the View mode based on Mime type is to have media with the image/jp2 mime-type configured to use to use the OpenSeadragon viewer, but to manually select the OpenSeadragon view mode for nodes with JPEG media (for example, a very large JPEG image of a map, where the OpenSeadragon's pan and zoom features would be useful). Members Islandora has a notion of membership , which is used to create a parent/child relationship between two resource nodes. Membership is denoted using another special field, \"Member Of\". The \"Member Of\" field can hold multiple references, so it is possible for a single child to belong to multiple parents, but may also complicate the creation of breadcrumbs. Any two nodes can be related in this way, though typically, the parent node has a content model of Collection or Paged Content (see their respective pages for more details). Compared to Islandora 7 In Islandora 7, there was a distinction between belonging to a collection and belonging to a compound object. In Islandora 8, this distinction is not present, essentially allowing every resource node to be part of a compound object. Child v. Member Islandora 8 uses the \"child\" and \"member\" descriptor for resource nodes that store a reference to another resource node in the \"Member Of\" field interchangeably. Administrators will more often see the \"member\" terminology more often while front-end users will usually see \"child\" terminology. For any node, its Children tab can be used to see all its members. You can also perform Actions in bulk on members using the checkboxes and the Actions dropdown as well as clicking on the Re-order Children tab to adjust the order in which they display.","title":"Resource Nodes"},{"location":"user-documentation/resource-nodes/#properties","text":"Resource nodes have some basic properties that are common to all nodes, regardless of its content type.

This guide gives an overview to the setup provided by the islandora-playbook. Much more detail is available in the Search API documentation . Another helpful resource is Adam Fuch's \"Drupal 8 Custom Site Search with Search API\" (https://www.electriccitizen.com, 2018-01-10; last accessed 2019-03-08). Indexing Islandora 8 with SOLR To access the search indexing settings navigate to '/admin/config/search/search-api'. SOLR Server Configuration Use the 'Solr Server' link to view the SOLR server's configuration and the 'Default Solr content index' link to view or update the index settings. In most cases, where the site was built using Ansible, the 'Solr Server' settings that were configured during installation should be left alone. SOLR Index Configuration The Default Solr content index user interface is divided into four tabs: 'View', 'Edit', 'Fields', and 'Processors'. View Tab The 'View' tab gives an overview of the index and its status: - 'Index status' is a progress bar that indicates how many items have been indexed. - 'Status' allows you to enable/disable the index from being used. - 'Datasource' indicates what types of entities are being indexed and how many have. - 'Tracker' states which item tracker is being used. - 'Server' provides a link to the SOLR server's configuration page. - 'Server index status' is a count of the total number of items returned from an unfiltered empty search. Generally speaking, this should match the total number of items indexed. See the Drupal 8 Search API FAQ for more details. - 'Cron batch size' displays how many items will be indexed when Drupal's cron runs. The 'View' tab also provides links to some common actions. 'Start Indexing Now' allows you to start a indexing job for a specified number of items (default is 'all'). You can also specify how many items should be indexed in each batch (default is '50'). The other links allow a repository manager to queue all objects for reindexing, clear the index, or rebuild tracking information. Edit Tab The 'Edit' tab allows repository managers to configure how the index works as a whole, including the Index name, the data sources\u2014entity types\u2014it can index (including which specific content types or taxonomies will be indexed), which server it is connected to, and other SOLR-specific options. 'Content' (types) is the only data source enabled by default. Selecting 'Taxonomy term' will enable searching taxonomies which is recommended if the repository uses taxonomies for subjects or other discovery points. Once the data sources are enabled a configuration box for each of them will appear in a section just below the list of data sources. This allows repository managers to select which content types (or taxonomy vocabularies) will be included in the index. By default all the content types, and vocabularies if the taxonomy data source is enabled, are indexed. Note: the defaults assume a repository is adding content using the web interface. If a repository manager plans on bulk-loading content they should disable the 'Index items immediately' option in the expandable 'Index Options' box and increase the 'Cron batch size' option. Fields Tab The 'Fields' tab allows repository managers to select which fields will be indexed. The default set of fields enabled come from a standard Drupal installation and do not reflect the fields Islandora adds for 'Repository Item'. Repository managers need to add the fields necessary for their Islandora instance. To add a field, click the '+ Add fields' button. A shadow-box will appear with a list of the fields available for the index. Some fields, such as the 'Body' ('body') field provided by Drupal, have multiple properties which can be completely different values or variations on the same value. Click on the plus-sign next to the field to show the properties available to index. In most cases repository managers can ignore the properties list and click the 'Add' button by the field to index the default property ('value'). Only select a different field property if you understand how it will impact user searching. Entity reference fields, such as Tags ('field_tags'), allow you to select fields or their properties from the referenced entity for indexing, such as a referenced taxonomy term's name field. Once the fields are added they can be configured further on the 'Fields' tab, although the label, machine name, and type usually don't need to be changed. The 'Type' dropdown has several different Full-text processing options available, which may be of interest. Each is described in the expandable 'Data Types' box at the bottom of the page. The 'Boost' setting allows repository managers to increase the weight of particular fields when calculating search relevancy. Processors Tab The 'Processors' tab allows repository managers to adjust how data and search queries are processed to adjust results. The defaults are acceptable in most cases. Searching Islandora 8 The Search API SOLR module comes with a search page pre-configured (accessible at '/solr-search/content'). To edit the search page, navigate to '/admin/structure/views/view/solr_search_content'. Repository managers may want to change the URL used to access the page, add it to the site navigation, or add a search box. In the 'Page Settings' box in the middle of the page, click on the existing path to open a shadow-box with an edit field. Change the URL as desired, for example, to 'search' and click 'Apply'. Then, click the 'No menu' link just below it to open the menu settings shadow-box. Selecting 'Normal menu entry' will allow a repository manager to add a menu link text, description, and place it within the site menu tree (the default, <Main navigation> works for most sites). A search box can be added by expanding the 'Advanced' options and changing the 'Exposed form in block' setting and then use the 'Block Layout' interface (found at '/admin/structure/block') to place the block where desired. After making changes to the View's settings, click the 'Save' button to ensure the changes are not lost. Islandora's Repository Items are displayed in the search results as a fully rendered entity by default. Repository managers can choose which view mode should be used for each search datasource by clicking the 'Settings' link next to the 'Show:' setting under the 'Format' section of the search view configuration page (shown in a red box in the screenshot below). The 'Teaser' and 'Search result highlighting input' are the two most likely options. Alternatively, repository managers can select specific fields to display instead by clicking the 'Rendered Entity' link and changing it to 'Fields' and then choosing which fields will be displayed in the 'Fields' section underneath. Note: thumbnails will not immediately be available using the Fields display option without more advanced configurations.","title":"Searching"},{"location":"user-documentation/searching/#setup-and-configure-search","text":"Islandora 8 comes with the Drupal 8 Search API and SOLR modules enabled with a corresponding SOLR instance.

The other links allow a repository manager to queue all objects for reindexing, clear the index, or rebuild tracking information.","title":"View Tab"},{"location":"user-documentation/searching/#edit-tab","text":"The 'Edit' tab allows repository managers to configure how the index works as a whole, including the Index name, the data sources\u2014entity types\u2014it can index (including which specific content types or taxonomies will be indexed), which server it is connected to, and other SOLR-specific options. 'Content' (types) is the only data source enabled by default. Selecting 'Taxonomy term' will enable searching taxonomies which is recommended if the repository uses taxonomies for subjects or other discovery points. Once the data sources are enabled a configuration box for each of them will appear in a section just below the list of data sources. This allows repository managers to select which content types (or taxonomy vocabularies) will be included in the index. By default all the content types, and vocabularies if the taxonomy data source is enabled, are indexed. Note: the defaults assume a repository is adding content using the web interface. If a repository manager plans on bulk-loading content they should disable the 'Index items immediately' option in the expandable 'Index Options' box and increase the 'Cron batch size' option.","title":"Edit Tab"},{"location":"user-documentation/searching/#fields-tab","text":"The 'Fields' tab allows repository managers to select which fields will be indexed. The default set of fields enabled come from a standard Drupal installation and do not reflect the fields Islandora adds for 'Repository Item'. Repository managers need to add the fields necessary for their Islandora instance. To add a field, click the '+ Add fields' button. A shadow-box will appear with a list of the fields available for the index. Some fields, such as the 'Body' ('body') field provided by Drupal, have multiple properties which can be completely different values or variations on the same value. Click on the plus-sign next to the field to show the properties available to index. In most cases repository managers can ignore the properties list and click the 'Add' button by the field to index the default property ('value'). Only select a different field property if you understand how it will impact user searching. Entity reference fields, such as Tags ('field_tags'), allow you to select fields or their properties from the referenced entity for indexing, such as a referenced taxonomy term's name field. Once the fields are added they can be configured further on the 'Fields' tab, although the label, machine name, and type usually don't need to be changed. The 'Type' dropdown has several different Full-text processing options available, which may be of interest. Each is described in the expandable 'Data Types' box at the bottom of the page. The 'Boost' setting allows repository managers to increase the weight of particular fields when calculating search relevancy.","title":"Fields Tab"},{"location":"user-documentation/searching/#processors-tab","text":"The 'Processors' tab allows repository managers to adjust how data and search queries are processed to adjust results. The defaults are acceptable in most cases.","title":"Processors Tab"},{"location":"user-documentation/searching/#searching-islandora-8","text":"The Search API SOLR module comes with a search page pre-configured (accessible at '/solr-search/content'). To edit the search page, navigate to '/admin/structure/views/view/solr_search_content'. Repository managers may want to change the URL used to access the page, add it to the site navigation, or add a search box. In the 'Page Settings' box in the middle of the page, click on the existing path to open a shadow-box with an edit field. Change the URL as desired, for example, to 'search' and click 'Apply'. Then, click the 'No menu' link just below it to open the menu settings shadow-box. Selecting 'Normal menu entry' will allow a repository manager to add a menu link text, description, and place it within the site menu tree (the default, <Main navigation> works for most sites). A search box can be added by expanding the 'Advanced' options and changing the 'Exposed form in block' setting and then use the 'Block Layout' interface (found at '/admin/structure/block') to place the block where desired. After making changes to the View's settings, click the 'Save' button to ensure the changes are not lost. Islandora's Repository Items are displayed in the search results as a fully rendered entity by default. Repository managers can choose which view mode should be used for each search datasource by clicking the 'Settings' link next to the 'Show:' setting under the 'Format' section of the search view configuration page (shown in a red box in the screenshot below). The 'Teaser' and 'Search result highlighting input' are the two most likely options. Alternatively, repository managers can select specific fields to display instead by clicking the 'Rendered Entity' link and changing it to 'Fields' and then choosing which fields will be displayed in the 'Fields' section underneath.

It will go in depth on how Islandora allows you to use the various features of Drupal to construct and display repository items. Islandora, like Drupal, provides tools to create a site, but does not force you to conform to any specific site structure, organization, or navigation. There is a hope that we can provide something useful out of the box, while also allowing the full suite of Drupal configuration options. This out-of-the-box configuration is the Islandora Demo module. It is recommended to be familiar with the basics of Drupal, including content types, fields, users, and views. The Official Drupal 8 User Guide and the Community Guide to Drupal 8 are a good place to start. Object Modeling In Islandora, when we say object , we mean a collection of properties describing something. And when we say datastream , we mean a file that is a digital representation of an object. Content in our repositories is stored as an object that is associated with any number of datastreams. In Drupal terms, that makes everything an entity , where An object is a node (a.k.a. content ). Nodes have properties that can be configured called fields . Fields for nodes are grouped together as content types . Datastreams are media , which are files that can have their own fields and media types . Metadata used to categorize entities are taxonomy terms , which also have their own fields and vocabularies . They can represent everything from simple labels to more complex concepts such as people, places, and subjects. Fedora Islandora 7.x basically inherits its object model from Fedora 3.x. In 7.x, Fedora stores all properties and content associated with an object - not only its owner, dc.title, status, PID, and status, but also any content files such as OBJ, DC, MODS, and RELS-EXT. In Islandora 7.x, Fedora is the authoritative, primary source for all aspects of an object. Fedora 3.x is not an optional component of an Islandora 7.x repository, it is the primary datastore. In Islandora 8, using Fedora is optional. That's right, optional. Drupal, and not Fedora, is the primary source of all aspects of an Islandora 8 object, and, with some variations, Drupal, not Fedora, is the primary datastore in an Islandora repository. If Fedora is present in an Islandora 8 repository, content in it is a tightly synchronized copy of object properties and files managed by Drupal. Even though Fedora is optional in Islandora 8, most repositories will use it since it provides its own set of services that are worth taking advantage of, such as: flexible, and configurable, disk storage architecture fixity digest generation Memento versioning integration with RDF/Linked Data triplestores Integration with Microservices via API-X WebAC Policies for access control In Islandora repositories that use Fedora, all properties about Drupal nodes are mirrored in Fedora as RDF properties. But, even if an Islandora instance does not use Fedora, Drupal can provide an object's properties as RDF (again, Drupal is the primary source of data in Islandora 8). In addition, the Drupal media associated with Islandora 8 objects are persisted to Fedora, although exactly which media is configurable within the Islandora 8 admin interface. Just as Drupal out of the box has a public and private filesystem, Islandora adds a third filesystem to Drupal called, not surprisingly, \"fedora\", and it is to this filesystem that media are persisted. We will provide more information about Fedora's role in an Islandora 8 repository in the metadata and media sections. Architecture Conceptual Diagram Many users of Islandora may be familiar with the metahprocial diagram of Islandora 7 as a cheeseburger, which provides a memorable approximation of how the different parts of the software stack interact in a vertically-integrated, relatively customizable fashion (ie, Drupal, Solr, Islandora, and Fedora are stable layers, and the \"toppings\" stand in for Solution Packs and other utilities that can be added or removed to customize Islandora): For a similar conceptual approach to Islandora 8, we present it as a bento box: a very modular platform, in which each piece may be removed and replaced with something different, without disrupting other parts of the stack: For a true diagram of how the various parts of Islandora 8 interact, please see the full Architecture Diagram","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"user-documentation/user-intro/#object-modeling","text":"In Islandora, when we say object , we mean a collection of properties describing something.
