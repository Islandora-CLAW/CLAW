You will need to copy the configuration file [_example.settings.yml_](config/example.settings.yml) to either **settings.yml** or **settings.dev.yml** (if $app['debug'] = TRUE) and change any required settings.

## Services

The TransactionService provides the following endpoints for HTTP requests. 

**Note**: The transaction ID (or txID) is of the form `tx:83e34464-144e-43d9-af13-b3464a1fb9b5`

1. POST to `/transaction`

    for creating a new transaction. It returns the transaction ID in the Location: header. It can be retrieved by passing the Response to the `getId()` function.
    
2. POST to `/transaction/{txID}/extend`

    for extending a transaction. Normally a transaction will expire once it has sat for approximately 3 minutes without any interactions. This allows you to extend the transaction without performing any other interaction.
    
3. POST to `/transaction/{txID}/commit`

    to commit the transaction.
    
4. POST to `/transaction/{txID}/rollback`

    to rollback a transaction
