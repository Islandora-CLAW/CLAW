## Create / Update a View

Views allow you to get content from Islandora (as nodes) and display on your site in pages or as posts, lists, blocks, etc. Views are powerful and filter content from Islandora to enable you to present content in interesting and exciting ways. 

Islandora 8 ships with views already created and turned on. The Islandora 8 home page displays content items that have been added to Islandora. This view is named ‘Frontpage’ and list items that meet the following Filter Criteria. The item is published and the checkbox ‘Promoted to front page’ is selected. This view will display all content items added to Islandora as the checkbox ‘Promoted to front page’ is on by default. 

As you develop your Islandora Web site it is likely that will need to change this default behaviour of the ‘Frontpage’ view. The two tasks demonstrate how to edit the ‘FrontPage’ view and to create a new view.

### Task 1: Edit the ‘Frontpage’ page view to only show content items and not collections

For this example, we have added six collection items to Islandora 8. Now, in total there are eight items in the repository. In addition to the six collection items there is one audio item and one image item.

1. Using your Web browser open the Islandora 8 Frontpage (localhost:8000)
    1. For this example, we can see that Islandora displays a ‘Collection’ first as this is the most recently added item.
2. To edit a view, hover over the view (‘Frontpage’ view) and select “Edit view” when displayed.
