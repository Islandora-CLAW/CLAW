The collection is created. It is a Drupal node that acts as the “parent” node for all objects (photographs) in the collection. This relationship is created by the user. A collection does not have to be created first. Objects can be loaded and then “linked” to the collection, which is a Drupal node.

To populate the collection, return to the main page and any existing objects (in this example, photographs). Click on one, and select Edit. This brings up the form for this photograph.
