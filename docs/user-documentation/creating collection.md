Click on Add content. This is under Tools.
Then click on Repository Item. A collection is considered a "Repository Item."
Fill out the form.
Near the end of the form, under System, select Collection from the Model drop down list. 
Click Save when done.
The collection is created. It is a Drupal node that acts as the “parent” node for all objects (photographs) in the collection. This relationship is created by the user. A collection does not have to be created first. Objects can be loaded and then “linked” to the collection, which is a Drupal node. 
To populate the collection, return to the main page and any existing objects (in this example, photographs). Click on one, and select Edit. 
This brings up the form for this photograph. Scroll down to the bottom and the System section. In the Member of section, start typing in the name of the collection this photograph should belong to. Select it when it comes up as an option. 
The correct collection is now selected.  Click Save when ready. 
To confirm, return to the main site and the Snowfall collection. The Snow photograph now appears as a member of the Snowfall collection.
