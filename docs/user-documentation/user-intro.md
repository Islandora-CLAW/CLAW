# Introduction to Islandora CLAW

This _User Documentation_ section is aimed at site admins and repository managers who need to understand and configure their Islandora. It will go in depth on how Islandora allows you to use the various features of Drupal to construct and display repository items.

Islandora, like Drupal, provides tools to create a site, but does not force you to conform to any specific site structure, organization, or navigation. There is a hope that we can provide something useable out of the box, while also allowing the full suite of Drupal configuration options. This out-of-the-box configuration is the Islandora Demo module.

It is recommended to be familiar with the basics of Drupal, including content types, fields, users, and views. The [Official Drupal 8 User Guide](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8) and the [Community Guide to Drupal 8](https://www.drupal.org/docs/user_guide/en/index.html) are a good place to start.
