## Context in Islandora 8

[Context](https://www.drupal.org/project/context) is a Drupal subsystem that allows the configuration of "if this, then that" logic using an administrative user interface. Some Islandora 7.x repositories used the community-contributed [Islandora Context](https://github.com/SFULibrary/islandora_context) module to apply this sort of logit to Islandora objects. Context defines "conditions" and "reactions" to enact the "if this [condition], then that [reaction]" logic. An example Context from Islandora 7.x is

> "If an object's namespace is 'customnamespace', render this block containing the rights statement 'Please contact Special Collections before reusing this item'."

The sentence from the Context project page "You can think of each context as representing a 'section' of your site." doesn't tell the whole story, since it gives the impression that Context is all about defining subsites. Even though Context in Drupal 8 is not part of the Drupal core, it is much more powerful in Drupal 8 than in Drupal 7 due to how it interacts with the rest of Drupal (specifically, through Drupal 8's new plugin API). Becuase of this increased flexibility and power, and because Context provides a ready-made user interface for administrators to combine conditions and reactions, Islandora 8 uses Context's abilities to drive the logic that does things like persist media to Fedora, generate derivatives, and determine how objects are displayed.
