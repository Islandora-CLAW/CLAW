    * Files are attached to Nodes through Media (intermediary objects).
    * Media objects can also contain technical metadata about the files.
    * We use tags on the Media objects to determine how to display them (e.g. OpenSeadragon)
    * You can see what media is attached to a node on the node's "Media" tab
    * When you make a Media, it asks for a(nother) title and some alt-text. What should I put there? The node's title? Something else?
    * Where are files actually stored? See todo: make Flysystem section.
    * What does it mean for your content to be in Fedora? How does that happen and how do we check?
    * See access control section as it relates to files.
