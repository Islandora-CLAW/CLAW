To load media in Islandora, first click on Add content. This is under Tools.
Then click on Repository Item.
Fill out the form.
Near the end of the form, under System, select the appropriate format. This will impact the display of the object through different viewers. Selecting the “Model” here is a major difference from Islandora 7. In 8, there are no content models or Solution Packs. Instead display of different formats is handled through Drupal.  
When done, click Save. The Drupal “node” for the object has been created. This will allow the file to interact with Drupal and allow you to control it using Drupal.  The actual object file still needs to be loaded.
To load the file, click on Media. 
Then click on Add Media. 
Click on image if you are loading a photograph (png, gif, jpg, jpeg). If loading another image file type, select file from the options.
Adding the image (loading the digital file):
1. Enter the title of the image.
2. Load the image, either here or using drag and drop if available.
Select the Media Use from the drop down. This is usually "Original File" but may vary depending on your use case.
Click save when done. 
The file is now loaded. Return to the main site to view the image.
