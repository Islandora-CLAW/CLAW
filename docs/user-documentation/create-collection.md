# Creating a Collection

To create a collection, please follow these steps:

1. Click the '+Add Content' button
2. Select 'Repository Item'
3. Fill in the metadata you would like. At a minimum, a Collection requires a title and the selection of 'Collection' under System > Model. It's also recommended to choose 'Collection' as the Resource Type, and fill out a Description and Date Created
4. Click the 'Save' button at the end of the form

You will now see the Drupal node of the Collection you just created. The `Members' heading will have no content following it. Please proceed to [Add a Member to a Collection](https://islandora-claw.github.io/CLAW/)
