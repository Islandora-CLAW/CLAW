# IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework)

IIIf is a set of specifications that provides interoperability of image-based collections across platforms. What this means for a repository platform like Islandora is that image-based objects such as (still) images and paged content can be managed by Islandora but viewed in external applications, and that Islandora can bring in image-based content from elsewhere to supplement locally managed content.

At a practial level, because Islandora supports several of the IIIF specifications, we can:

- Zoom, pan, and rotate images within OpenSeadragon
- See thumbnails for all pages of a book or newspaper issue within OpenSeadragon
