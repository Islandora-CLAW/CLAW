# 8.x-2.0 Release Notes

## Removing Gemini
It is recommended to test this method in a staging/development environment before running in your production environment.
1. Update islandora core (likely through a command like `composer update islandora/islandora`)
2. Import two new Islandora views

    i. This can be done by coping the views into a new directory and using drush such as 
    ```
    mkdir /var/www/html/drupal/config/1time
    cp /var/www/html/drupal/web/modules/contrib/islandora/modules/islandora_core_feature/config/install/views.view.all_taxonomy_terms.yml /var/www/html/drupal/config/1time/
    cp /var/www/html/drupal/web/modules/contrib/islandora/modules/islandora_core_feature/config/install/views.view.non_fedora_files.yml /var/www/html/drupal/config/1time/
    drush config:import --partial --source /var/www/html/drupal/config/1time
    ```
    ii. It can also be done through the UI at `/admin/config/development/configuration/single/import`
3. Update crayfish-commons for drupal with something like `cd /var/www/html/drupal && composer update islandora/crayfish-commons`
4. Update Crayfish code (likely by traversing to your crayfish installation and doing a git pull `cd /var/www/html/Crayfish && git pull`)
5. Run composer install for Milliner such as `cd /var/www/html/Crayfish/Milliner && composer install`
6. Run composer install for Recast such as `cd /var/www/html/Crayfish/Recast && composer install`
7. Update the Recast config 

    i. `cd /var/www/html/Crayfish/Recast/cfg`
    ii. open `config.yaml`
    iii. Remove `gemini_base_url`
    iv. Update `base_url` in `fedora_resource` section. It should contain a value something like `http://localhost:8080/fcrepo/rest`
8. Clear your cache in Drupal. Potentially like `cd /var/www/html/drupal && drush cr`
9. Restart apache (not 100% sure if this is necesssary) `sudo systemctl restart apache2`
9. Test to make sure you can view existing objects in Fedora by going to the Drupal UI and clicking one of the Fedora URI links
10. Create a new object and make sure it persists to Fedora and the Fedora URI likn resolves correctly. Make sure that no new entries get added to Gemini.
11. If you're feeling brave, you can then remove Gemini like
    i. `rm /var/www/html/Crayfish/Gemini`
    ii. Remove the gemini database and the associated mysql user
