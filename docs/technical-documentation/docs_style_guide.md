# Documentation Style Guide

## Do's

- Submit documentation formatted in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format.
  -- Please add Markdown headings to the content sections.
- Use a GitHub Pull Request to submit documentation.
- Use the "bold/emphasis" style  in Markdown for UI elements that users will interact with. For example, a button label for a button that must be pressed should be made bold in Markdown.
- Use the "italics" style in Markdown for UI elements that have a label or title if you need to reference them in the documentation. For example, a title of a screen or page that will visit should be made italic in Markdown.

## Don'ts

- Do not leave any "trailing spaces" at the end of lines of content.
- Do not use "curly" quotes and apostrophes, use only "straight" quotes and apostrophes.
