<a href="https://islandora.ca">Islandora</a> is an open-source repository framework, that combines a Drupal front-end
with a Fedora repository. It is a solution for institutions who want an extremely flexible and configurable preservation repository without creating a lot of custom code.

Islandora 8 integrates [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) (currently, Drupal 8) and Duraspace's [Fedora Repository](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FF/Fedora+Repository+Home) project (currently, Fedora 5).

Islandora 8 allows you to create nodes, media, files, and taxonomy terms in Drupal, which are converted to RDF
and pushed into a Fedora repository. It also allows you to connect repository content with microservices, small webapps that transform files to other types for display or preservation, or to extract additional metadata.
